Executive Summary 

 New research shows the aviation sector has emerged as one of the strongest opponents of climate 

policy in Europe. While many industrial sectors are in the process of transformation in response to the 

EU’s strengthened climate agenda, the aviation sector has instead pursued a lobbying strategy to avoid 

effective regulation. The research further shows that many airlines have initiated extensive, climate-

focused PR campaigns to deflect growing concern from governments and the public over the sector’s 

climate footprint. At the same time, the ten airlines covered by the study have accepted around €30bn 

in government bailouts since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis.  

 The research highlights a threat to the EU’s climate targets if the aviation sector’s emissions are allowed 

to grow at pre-COVID-19 trajectories, with European GHG emissions from aviation more than doubling 

from 1990-2018. This is significant given the EU Commission will announce its key policies to 

decarbonize aviation as part of the European Green Deal in July 2021. The findings will be of particular 

interest to European investors who, through the Climate Action 100+ aviation sector strategy, have 

recommended that the sector engages with national, regional, and international climate policy in a way 

that is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. 

 The analysis draws from InfluenceMap’s platform which assesses policy engagement against Paris-

aligned government and science-based benchmarks, covering over 300 companies and 150 industry 

associations globally. This research covers the 10 largest European airline companies by GHG 

emissions, along with the two largest global aircraft manufacturers (Airbus and Boeing) and two key 

industry associations (International Air Transport Association and Airlines for Europe). It involved the 

collection and analysis of around 800 individual items of evidence on climate policy engagement, with 

nearly 60% of these dated since 2020. This includes a significant amount of previously unseen 

information, accessed from over 20 freedom of information requests by InfluenceMap. 

European Airlines Compared on Climate Policy Engagement 
 Negative climate lobbying efforts appear to be led (with their climate policy engagement scores in 

brackets on a scale of A to F) by Air France-KLM (E+), International Airlines Group (IAG) (E+), 

Lufthansa (E+), and Ryanair (E), the four European airlines with the largest disclosed CO2 emissions in 

2019. They are joined by two main aviation industry groups, International Air Transport Association 

(IATA) (E+), and Airlines for Europe (A4E) (E+). Collectively, these entities have actively opposed key 

national and EU aviation climate policies including the full inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions 

Trading System (EU ETS), kerosene fuel taxes, and ticket taxes on flights.  

 In contrast, easyJet (D) appears to have a more mixed stance, with more progressive positions on 

numerous EU climate policies including a kerosene fuel tax.  The other five largest airlines by disclosed 

CO2 emissions (Virgin Atlantic, Scandinavian Airlines SAS, TAP Air Portugal, Norwegian Air Shuttle

ASA, and Wizz Air) appear to have very limited direct engagement with climate policy, but most retain 

memberships of Airlines for Europe and/or IATA.  As do both Boeing (D-) and Airbus (D) where there is 

likewise limited transparency on EU policy engagement positions and activities, despite the significance 

of the two companies to delivering a low-carbon transition for aviation (collectively they represent 

around 99% of global large plane orders and 90% of the worldwide plane market).  

COVID-Related Bailouts to Airlines and Climate Policy Scores 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Negative aviation lobbying presents a clear risk to science-based policy required in Europe to reach the 

temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, as recently detailed in the scenarios of the IPCC 1.5C and IEA 

Net Zero by 2050 reports. The sector’s positions also seem at odds with EU policymakers, as Europe's 

climate goals could be undermined by a sector refusing to contribute its fair share. The UN Principles 

for Responsible Investment considers corporate misalignment with ‘inevitable’ regulatory measures on 

climate a critical source of market risk, likely to build in 2023-25 as governments accelerate policy action. 

 It is likely far that more forceful engagement by investors on the aviation sector will be needed, given 

their apparent strategic opposition to all EU and European regulatory measures to achieve medium-

term and long-term climate targets. This may include a focus by investors on the use of shareholder 

resolutions should progress not be forthcoming, with climate lobbying resolutions already filed in 2021 

to United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (see InfluenceMap's response here) in the US. The latter is a key 

trend within investor stewardship of companies on climate, and the aviation sector will likely be in 

focus here.

The Lobbying Strategy of Europe’s Aviation Sector 
 This research identifies a two-point strategy used by the sector to avoid regulation directly addressing 

their climate emissions.  Firstly, at a European level, the industry has communicated high-level support 

for net-zero EU aviation emissions by 2050 while opposing specific national and EU-level climate 

regulations to help deliver that target in their direct engagements with policymakers. Secondly, at a 

global level through the UN body for aviation, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), 

industry has lobbied for the CORSIA offsetting scheme to take precedent over policies addressing 

absolute aviation emissions reductions. At the same time, using the context of the COVID-19 

pandemic, industry lobbyists have successfully pushed for the scheme to be watered down further.  

The Aviation Sector’s Climate Policy Strategy Explained 

 In Europe, this climate policy engagement has been led by Airlines for Europe (A4E) which has pushed 

for the EU ETS for intra-EU flights to be replaced with a hybrid CORSIA-EU ETS scheme, while 

opposing efforts to increase the EU ETS scope to all international flights to and from the EU. In contrast, 

European Commission research has found that CORSIA was "unlikely to materially alter the direct 

climate impact associated with air travel." In other 2020 EU consultation responses, A4E appeared 

opposed to a jet fuel tax and unsupportive of a stringent EU sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) mandate.

 At a global level, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has opposed the need for regional 

and national climate regulations for aviation and urged ICAO to prioritize the CORSIA offsetting scheme. 

At the same time, IATA led efforts at ICAO to weaken CORSIA in 2020 after a pandemic-driven decline 

in air travel. New evidence uncovered in an FOI request shows that IATA also lobbied EU officials at a 

private meeting in April 2020 to support such a change, later agreed by ICAO in June 2020.   

 The five largest European airlines, IATA, A4E, and the aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus have a 

collective annual EU lobbying expenditure of around €6.75 million according to their most recent 

disclosures to the European Transparency Register. However, this figure represents only a proportion of 

their overall climate-related policy engagement spend. It excludes expenditure on national level 

lobbying and other climate influencing activities (e.g., advertising, PR messaging etc.) as set out in the 

UN’s Guide for Responsible Corporate Engagement in Climate Policy but not covered by the register.  

 Newly uncovered documents reveal that, in addition to A4E and IATA, airlines including Air France-

KLM and Lufthansa have made use of another group, the Airline Coordination Platform, to push for 

weakening EU climate policies. The Airline Coordination Platform has no dedicated website and 

appears to be coordinated by an EU-based consultancy firm. In January 2021, Lufthansa emailed a 

policy document written by the Airline Coordination Platform to EU Commission officials. It advocated 

against an EU kerosene tax for reasons including it “would have a negative impact on the profitability of 

certain routes”, supported reforms to exclude feeder flights from the EU ETS for aviation, weakening the 

scheme, and appeared unsupportive of an EU sustainable aviation fuels blending mandate.  

 This research also finds the aviation industry has used the COVID-19 crisis to weaken European climate 

policy. New data from FOI requests reveal that Airbus and Air France privately lobbied EU 

policymakers to support subsidizing new aircraft purchases as part of an EU green stimulus scheme. An 

Air France-KLM paper sent to EU Commission officials in March 2021 appeared to support a green 

stimulus subsidy scheme for new aircraft. Similarly, in a February 2021 meeting with the EU 

Commission, an Airbus presentation advocated for EU policymakers to support an "aircraft fleet 

renewal" scheme as part of a "green stimulus" to provide “post C19 crisis support to airlines”. The 

COVID-19 crisis has also been invoked by the industry group Airlines for Europe to advocate to defer or 

waiver new aviation taxes, by Air France-KLM’s CEO to suspend new flight taxes, and by Lufthansa to 

oppose reforms to the EU ETS to include all international aviation emissions in its scope.  

 The European aviation industry has also invested in climate-focused PR and ad campaigns like those 

employed by Big Oil to link their brands to positive climate action, while simultaneously lobbying 

against climate regulations. These include rebranding carbon-intensive flights as 'green' and promoting 

lower-cost offsetting measures over absolute GHG emissions reductions. IATA coordinates the Fly 

Aware campaign, which attempts to shift the cost and responsibility of climate action from industry to 

consumers, and a new FOI reveals is designed to counter the flight shame (flygskam) movement.

European Aviation and Climate Change 
Aviation's Climate Impacts 
Aviation is one of the most carbon-intensive forms of transport, and its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 

continued to rapidly grow in Europe until the COVID-19 crisis. The European aviation industry is fossil fuel-

dependent, with oil-derived jet fuel directly estimated to account for over 97% of airline GHG emissions. Air 

transport on average is the least carbon-efficient form of passenger transport per kilometer in Europe, 

producing over four times the emissions of an equivalent journey by train, according to a March 2021 

European Environment Agency study. Yet rapid growth in air travel means flying is now one of Europe’s 

fastest-growing sources of GHG emissions, accounting for 3.9% of all EU GHG emissions in 2018, the 

second-largest transport emissions source after road transport.  

Since 1990, while overall GHG emissions in the EU have fallen by more than 25%, GHG emissions from 

aviation have more than doubled. Individual airlines have significantly contributed to Europe's climate 

impacts, with Ryanair in 2019 the seventh highest individual GHG emitter in the EU Emissions Trading System, 

alongside numerous coal plants in the top ten. Sector-wide, while GHG emissions in Europe fell by 3.7% 

compared to from 2018-19, in the same period European GHG emissions from international aviation rose by 

an estimated 3%, before a sharp COVID-19 driven decline in 2020-21.

The COVID-19 crisis has severely affected the European aviation industry, with numerous airlines 

threatened by collapse after European air traffic declined by 55% from 2019 to 2020, with airlines facing 

€22.2 billion in net losses in 2020 alone. Yet even taking into account a temporary post-COVID decline in 

demand, European air travel is still forecast to return to its 2019 flight peak as early as 2024, with post-

COVID industry forecasts from the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) projecting average annual growth of 

2.1% from 2018-38 for international European air traffic. In Europe, while efficiency improvements have 

reduced fuel burned per passenger by 24% between 2005-17, the rapid growth in flights, partly driven by the 

rise of low-cost airlines, has outpaced such efficiency improvements, with passengers flying on average 60% 

further from 2005-17. Consequently, as other European sectors begin to rapidly decarbonize, aviation's 

growth is projected to take an increasingly large share of Europe’s carbon budget, threatening the Paris 

Agreement's temperature goals.   

Furthermore, in November 2020 an EU Commission study for the first time comprehensively analyzed the 

non-GHG impacts of European aviation (including oxidized sulfur, soot particles, and nitrogen oxide). It 

discovered that aviation's non-CO2 effects may be two-thirds of aviation's total climate impact, with 

aviation's non-CO2 effects warming the climate twice as much as CO2 alone. Yet such climate impacts are 

currently unaccounted for in European climate legislation, with the EU Commission arguing the report’s 

findings “need to be addressed” in an accompanying note to policymakers.  

The IPCC and IEA on 1.5°C and Aviation 
The 2018 Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 

stated the urgent need for ambitious policy interventions by governments to dramatically lower global 

GHG emissions. Regarding transport, it noted that "the 1.5°C pathways require an acceleration of the 

mitigation solutions already featured in 2°C-consistent pathways (e.g., more efficient vehicle technologies 

operating on lower-carbon fuels), as well as those having received lesser attention in most global transport 

decarbonization pathways up to now (e.g., mode-shifting and travel demand management)."  

Consequently, significantly more ambitious policy for aviation is required both globally and in Europe to 

ensure the sector reduces its GHG emissions in line with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.  

In May 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its landmark Net Zero by 2050 report, detailing 

the policies required to meet the Paris climate accord goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-

industrial levels. Regarding aviation, some of the report's key findings to reach net-zero by 2050 include;  

 Emissions from heavy trucks, shipping, and aviation fall by an annual average of 6% between 2020 to 

2050 

 By 2040, 50% of fuels used in aviation are low emissions. Advanced liquid biofuels increase their 

share of the global aviation fuel market from 15% in 2030 to 45% in 2050.

 Of the emissions reductions in transport in 2050, nearly 80% come from measures to reduce 

passenger aviation demand, with the remainder from road transport. 

 The NZE (Net‐Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario) assumes that air travel, measured in revenue-

passenger kilometers, increases by only around 3% per year to 2050 relative to 2020. This compares 

with about around 6% over the 2010-19 period. The NZE assumes that aviation growth is constrained 

by comprehensive government policies that promote a shift towards high-speed rail and rein in the 

expansion of long-haul business travel, e.g. through taxes on commercial passenger flights 

European Climate Regulation for the Aviation Sector 
The EU and European national governments have recently vowed to take stronger climate action to reduce 

the climate impacts of aviation. In the EU, the Commission is considering numerous policies to decarbonize 

aviation as part of the European Green Deal, with key proposals now expected in July 2021. These regulations 

include the first EU-wide sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) mandate, a tax on jet fuel, and increasing the 

ambition of aviation’s inclusion in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).  

Such action comes after nine EU countries, including France and Germany, urged the EU in 2019 to tax 

aviation in line with other forms of transport to account for its environmental impacts. Similarly, in April 

2021, a cross-party group of 73 MEPs wrote to EU Commission leaders to "end the tax exemption for aviation 

fuel". Frans Timmermans, chief of the European Green Deal, further stated last year that "it is high time that 

the aviation industry would contribute to decarbonization like other industries" and in May 2021 backed calls 

to tax kerosene "like other fuels". Reports from May 2021 further suggest that European finance ministers 

were considering an EU-wide tax on kerosene jet fuel. A 2019 European Commission study found that 

European aviation “has a unique fiscal regime” wherein international flights are excluded from fuel taxes, 

unlike other transport modes like passenger cars. Moreover, unlike many cross-border European rail services, 

some European states exempt air tickets from paying VAT, and only a minority of EU member states levy 

ticket taxes on international aviation.  

Simultaneously, many European national governments are actively pursuing increasingly ambitious climate 

legislation for aviation. For example, in April 2021, France approved measures to ban short-haul domestic 

flights under 2.5 hours where rail alternatives exist, and in 2019-21 numerous states, from Germany to the 

Netherlands, have introduced new climate-related ticket taxes for flights. Additionally, in April 2021, the UK 

government announced that, for the first time, international aviation emissions will be included in its 78% 

2030 GHG emissions reduction target, with ambitious accompanying decarbonization measures soon 

expected. Subsequently, this analysis identifies the four, key European climate regulations for aviation over 

which industry is likely to be engaged in the following table.

The Global CORSIA Scheme and Europe 
While European governments have sought to introduce more ambitious climate policies, the aviation 

industry has instead argued that the carbon offset and reduction scheme for international aviation 

(CORSIA), a globally agreed offsetting scheme, should be Europe's primary climate regulation for flights. 

CORSIA was first agreed in 2016 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the UN agency 

responsible for global climate regulation for aviation. CORSIA, a market-based mechanism, requires airlines 

to purchase offsets or deploy lower-carbon fuels to compensate for aviation GHG emissions above a 2019 

baseline, while aviation's absolute GHG emissions can grow unchecked. The policy remains voluntary for all 

member states until 2027 and does not account for aviation's non-GHG climate effects, with a pilot phase 

operating from 2021-23 that represents around three-quarters of international flights, including all EU 

member states and the UK.  

CORSIA has been widely criticized for its reliance on offsetting and failure to reduce aviation's absolute 

GHG emissions. A previously unpublished report for the European Commission released in March 2021 

found that CORSIA was "unlikely to materially alter the direct climate impact associated with air travel", and

EU Emissions Trading 
System (EU ETS) 

EU 

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) includes aviation in the world's largest 
GHG emissions trading system. While the EU ETS was originally designed to 
apply to all flights to and from the EU, only intra-EU (EU to/from EU) flights are 
currently included until 2024, severely reducing the scheme's emissions 
reduction potential. As part of the European Green Deal, revisions to aviation in 
the EU ETS are currently being considered. These include proposals to address 
the EU ETS scope as regards to international (EU to/from non-EU) flights and 
reduce the significant free emissions allowances currently allocated to aviation. 

Kerosene-based jet 
fuel taxation 

EU and 
national 

Kerosene jet fuel is currently exempt from tax in Europe, unlike other fossil-based 
fuels for cars, and some cross-border rail services. Taxing jet fuel is currently 
being reviewed as part of the EU's Revision of the Energy Taxation Directive. 

Ticket taxes National 

In the absence of other climate-related regulations or taxes for aviation, many 
European states have introduced national ticket taxes for flights, citing 
environmental concerns. A 2019 European Commission study found that only six 
member states (including the UK) levied ticket taxes on flights, averaging €11 per 
ticket, with most European states applying no flight ticket taxes at all.  

Sustainable aviation 
fuels mandate 

EU 

Increased use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) is widely recognized to be 
crucial to the long-term decarbonization of aviation, especially for long-haul 
flights, yet SAFs currently represents only 0.05% of total jet fuel consumption. 
The EU Commission is reviewing the introduction of an EU-wide SAF mandate

would achieve little more than a scenario "in which international aviation emissions remain unregulated." It 

found that CORSIA-compliant carbon offset credits available to be purchased by airlines may be low 

quality, resulting in questions surrounding if such credits could achieve their stated emission reductions. The 

report concluded that "participating in CORSIA - and leaving all international aviation [….] outside the scope 

of the EU ETS" would risk undermining the EU's climate objectives, including a 2050 net-zero emissions 

target, and weakening current EU climate policies. In contrast, it found that expanding the EU ETS to 

include international (EU to/from EU) flights would lead to the largest GHG emissions reductions.  

Similarly, in an independent scientific analysis, Climate Action Tracker found that CORSIA and ICAO's 

aviation climate strategy is "critically insufficient" in meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, 

with aviation’s fair share of GHG emissions leading to a 4°C+ world. It describes CORSIA as having 

“significant shortcomings, meaning the scheme is highly unlikely to deliver the substantial reductions 

needed to achieve ICAO’s aspiration goal” of post-2020 carbon-neutral growth. It further criticized the 

quality of the carbon offsetting credits involved in CORSIA, the low decarbonization potential of alternative 

fuels that airlines can use under CORSIA, and ICAO's lack of Paris-aligned policies to decarbonize aviation. It 

estimates that under current global aviation climate policies, including CORSIA, and “taking into account 

the near-term adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel”, GHG emissions from international 

aviation are projected to increase by 220-290% between 2015 and 2050, putting the Paris Agreements’ 

temperature goals at risk. 

Investor Expectations for the Aviation Sector on Climate Change 
In January 2021, the Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) initiative released its aviation sector strategy, outlining 

recommended investor expectations on how the sector should manage climate-related risks and 

opportunities and position itself for the transition to a net-zero emissions economy. Regarding climate 

policy engagement, some of the report’s key recommendations are outlined below. 

 Lobby national, regional, and international policymakers in a manner that is transparent and consistent 

with the goals of the Paris Agreement. 

 Support ambitious national and regional climate change policy, and not lobby in a way that 

undermines Paris Agreement goals or ambitious national or regional climate change policy. 

 Establish robust governance procedures on climate lobbying, including conducting regular reviews of 

whether the lobbying activities of the company’s industry associations and industry bodies align with 

the goals of the Paris Agreement. 

 Be transparent about the company’s lobbying activities via appropriate disclosures. 

 Lobbying the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) 

to support a Paris Agreement-aligned decarbonization pathway for the industry.

Assessing Corporate Climate Policy Engagement 
Overview 
The IPCC’s October 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C laid out the urgency to act on climate 

and the key role of government policy in driving this process. However, current Nationally Determined 

Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement remain insufficient to meet even the 20C target and 

governments worldwide are lagging on introducing meaningful policy designed to drive this transition, 

according to a 2020 UNEP report. A key reason for this gap is both the historical and ongoing global 

opposition by corporate vested interests. Details of this are found within InfluenceMap's corporate policy 

engagement online report. 

To understand this picture at a company level, InfluenceMap maintains the world's leading platform 

tracking and scoring companies and industry associations on their climate policy engagement, a platform 

that has been operational since 2015. InfluenceMap's analysis and metrics inform the global institutional 

investor community who wish to have a full understanding of how corporations are impacting climate 

change. InfluenceMap introduced the concept of a corporation’s Carbon Policy Footprint (or Scope 4 
Emissions), a metric to be considered alongside its physical scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions (direct, supply chain, 

and product emissions, respectively). InfluenceMap’s methodology for scoring and ranking companies and 

industry associations based on their Carbon Policy Footprint is available here.     

InfluenceMap's analysis has featured in over 1,500 media articles and InfluenceMap is part of the Technical 

Advisory Group of the Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) investor engagement process with 540 investors with 

over $52 trillion in assets collectively under management. The CA100+ initiative works directly with the 

world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to ensure they take necessary action on climate change, 

including in their climate policy engagement.  

Methodology 
InfluenceMap has developed a process for scoring and ranking companies and industry associations on 

their activities to influence climate change policy. Full details of the methodology are provided on the page 

linked here.  Listed below are some of its key features and resulting outputs.  

■ InfluenceMap's system adheres to key features of sound corporate assessment metrics: objectivity, 

transparency, ease of comprehension and use, and includes like-for-like comparisons across and within 

sectors.    

■ InfluenceMap's system does not judge climate policy itself but instead measures corporate positions 

against Paris Agreement-aligned benchmarks of government policy and Science-Based Policy (SBP) 

benchmarks based on analysis of IPCC statements.

 InfluenceMap defines "policy engagement" based on the UN Guide for Responsible Corporate 

Engagement in Climate Policy (2013), which defines a range of corporate activities as engagement, such 

as advertising, social media, public relations, sponsoring research, and direct contact with regulators and 

elected officials.  

■ InfluenceMap relies on a range of data sources that are publicly accessible and are reliable 

representations of corporate policy engagement.  These include organizational websites, top 

management statements, regulatory consultation comments, financial disclosures, and reliable media 

reporting.   

■ Although the system does not require the cooperation of the organizations being assessed, 

InfluenceMap has engaged with over 100 large corporations, industry associations, and other 

stakeholders on our methodology and results. 

■ InfluenceMap's system is updated continuously as new information becomes available, which is then 

assessed and added to the InfluenceMap.org online database.  These results are freely available and in 

the public domain.  The results are provided in the form of metrics and analysis on individual 

organizations (see, for example, Unilever's online InfluenceMap profile), and CA100+ company tables. 

To assess which industry associations are the most influential on climate issues, InfluenceMap's method 

considers the following independent metrics: 

■ The Organization Score (0-100) expresses how supportive or obstructive the organization is towards 

climate policy aligned with the Paris Agreement, with 100 being fully supportive and 0 being fully 

opposed. 

■ The Engagement Intensity (0-100) expresses the intensity of this activity, whether positive or 

negative. 

 The Relationship Score (0-100) expresses how supportive or obstructive the company’s industry 

associations are towards climate policy aligned with the Paris Agreement, with 0 being fully opposed 

and 100 being fully supportive (aggregated).  

 The Performance Band (A+ - F) expresses a measure of a companies’ climate policy engagement that 

accounts for both its and its own industry groups' activity on an A+ through to F scale (A+ = support, F = 

opposition).

Corporate Lobbying on European Climate Policy for Aviation 
This chapter analyzes recent lobbying from the aviation industry over specific climate regulations in Europe. 

Introduction 
InfluenceMap has applied its methodology for assessing corporate influence over climate regulation to the 

European aviation industry. This analysis is based on over 800 independent data points, including data 

found from over 20 new freedom of information requests. It studies the direct climate policy engagement 

of the ten European airlines with the largest available disclosed GHG emissions in 2019, including both 

international (EU to/from non-EU) flights, and intra-EU flights 1. This data is combined with analysis of the 

two largest global aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, who collectively represent around 99% of 

global large plane orders and 90% of the worldwide plane market.  

The relative positions of the key airlines, manufacturers and airline trade associations in this study are 

summarized in the quadrant plot below.  

 

Aviation Companies and Industry Associations Compared on Climate Policy 
Engagement 

 
1 This ranking includes 2019 GHG emissions data from international flights for European airlines (KLM & Air France, and Iberia & British 

Airways emissions have been combined), apart from Wizz Air and Norwegian, where 2019 EU ETS transaction log data has been used.

The circle size for each airline represents their disclosed GHG emissions, with standardized circle sizes to 

further represent Boeing, Airbus, IATA, and A4E. Circles closer to the top-left hand corner are actively 

engaged and opposed to Paris-aligned climate policy, while circles closer to the top-right hand corner are 

actively engaged in support of Paris-aligned climate policy, with circles closer to the bottom having 

significantly less direct engagement with climate policy. Notably, every analyzed European airline and 

industry association has scored D or below, indicating sector-wide misalignment with the Paris Agreement. 

There is also a clear trend showing airlines with the largest CO2 emissions have the most active and 

negative climate policy engagement.  

This report further studies the indirect climate policy engagement of these companies through the most 

active aviation-related industry associations at a European (Airlines for Europe (A4E)) and global level 

(International Air Transport Association (IATA)), whose members collectively represent the wider aviation 

industry. All analyzed corporations, excluding Wizz Air, are a member of either association, with half of all 

studied corporations a member of both A4E and IATA. Full scoring profiles of each entity are available on 

the InfluenceMap website and details of company membership to A4E, and IATA are available in Appendix 1. 

The following quadrant plot contrasts airlines' climate policy engagement score with every other European 

CA100+ company in the InfluenceMap system (InfluenceMap's full CA100+ scoring available here).

Notably, the airline sector is clustered in the bottom left-hand side of the table, with considerably more 

collective misalignment than other analyzed sectors. Unlike other sectors, such as utilities (green), the 

airline sector (gray) is relatively unified in its opposition to Paris-aligned policy, with its scoring range (E to 

D), This Europe-wide sector comparison shows that the aviation sector is a significant laggard when it 

comes to Paris-aligned climate policy engagement in Europe. 

Detailed Results of InfluenceMap’s Analysis 
The European aviation industry has actively and collectively opposed key strands of European climate 

regulation for aviation aligned with the Paris Agreement in 2019-21. The sector has strong alignment in their 

opposition to key Paris-aligned climate policies in Europe, including taxes on jet fuels and flight tickets and 

the full inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS, while taking a more mixed position on an EU-wide SAF 

mandate. A complete table detailing company-level and industry association engagement on European 

climate policy for aviation is in Appendix 2, with full company lobbying scorecards on specific policies 

available in Appendix 3.  

 The four largest European airlines by GHG emissions (Air France-KLM, International Airlines Group 
(IAG), Lufthansa , and Ryanair), representing over 50% of EU flight passengers in 2019, have the most 

active and negative climate policy engagement. They therefore likely have the largest carbon policy 

footprints (scope 4 emissions) in Europe, with all four airlines disclosing the largest EU lobbying spend 

of all airlines covered in this report (see Aviation spending on climate lobbying). Three of these airlines 

further have historically close ties to key European governments (Air-France KLM, Lufthansa, and 

International Airlines Group – whose airlines include British Airways, Iberia, and Vueling) and have 

collectively received the three largest COVID-19 government bailouts in Europe (see image below).

 The aviation sector is supported in their negative lobbying by key two industry associations of which 

many airlines and aircraft manufacturers are members (see Appendix 1), Airlines for Europe (A4E) and 

the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Through these associations, aviation companies 

have indirectly engaged to oppose Paris-aligned climate policy for aviation. This is led by Airlines for 

Europe at a European level and IATA at a global level.  

 The aviation industry has actively opposed measures to increase the ambition of the EU Emissions 

Trading System (EU ETS) for aviation. In multiple 2020-21 EU consultation responses, A4E appears to 

have advocated replacing the direct regulation of intra-EU aviation emissions under the EU ETS, with a 

hybrid system including both the EU ETS and CORSIA. At the same time, A4E has questioned the 

legality of the proposal to extend the EU ETS to international (EU to/from non-EU) flights and opposed 

a reduction in free EU ETS emissions allowances.  

 Furthermore, extensive new evidence accessed by InfluenceMap via FOI requests2 reveals multiple 

instances of industry privately lobbying EU officials to weaken or replace the EU ETS as a measure to 

address aviation emissions in 2020-21 by playing it off against the UN’s CORSIA offsetting scheme (a 

strategy explained in detail the following chapter). Notes from a private February 2020 meeting between 

IATA and EU Commission staff disclose IATA viewed the EU ETS as "endangering CORSIA", with IATA 

calling on the "EU to show full support to CORSIA" as "the only global market based measure to apply". 

In a January 2021 email to EU Vice-President of the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, 

Lufthansa advocated for policies including the potential exemption of intra-EU feeder flights from the EU 

ETS, and in a March 2021 policy paper emailed to EU Commission officials, Air France-KLM advocated 

that "changes to the EU ETS must allow for a full and proper implementation of CORSIA". Similarly, 

IAG's 2020 CDP disclosure states they are "actively lobbying UK and EU Governments on the issue that 

CORSIA should replace aviation’s inclusion in the EU ETS" 

 The sector has also opposed an EU-wide kerosene tax on jet fuel in 2019-21. In 2020 EU consultation 

responses to the Energy Taxation Directive, Airlines for Europe, Air France-KLM, Ryanair, and IATA 

directly advocated to EU policymakers to oppose an EU kerosene tax on jet fuel. Furthermore, in a 

2019 press conference, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, appeared to oppose a jet fuel tax, asserting that 

"fuel taxes damage EU competitiveness and distort traffic flows".  

 The aviation industry has actively opposed national ticket taxes for flights in 2019-21. In April 2020 

KLM appeared to oppose a Netherlands ticket tax, communicating that taxes "do not help the 

environment", with Air France-KLM's CEO, Ben Smith, later similarly stressing new taxes "do not

support emissions reductions" to oppose increasing French ticket taxes in September 2020. 

Furthermore, IATA messaging in 2019-20 stated opposition to ticket taxes in Switzerland, France, and 

Germany. and a Lufthansa spokesperson advocated against increasing the German ticket tax for flights 

in 2020. 

 In contrast, the aviation industry has mixed to negative engagement with an EU sustainable aviation 

fuels (SAFs) mandate. In an April 2020 EU consultation response, Airlines for Europe argued a SAF 

mandate should only be considered "under mature market conditions". Similarly, new FOI requests 

accessed by InfluenceMap reveal that Air France advocated that an EU SAF mandate should only be 

introduced on a "mature" market in a March 2021 paper emailed to EU Commission officials, with 

Lufthansa further emphasized “competitiveness issues” around a SAF mandate in private emails to EU 

Commission officials in January and February 2021. In an April 2020 EU consultation response, IAG 

urged policymakers to only include intra-EU flights in a SAF mandate, while asserting they are lobbying 

to "prevent mandates that create competitive distortion […] at EU and UK levels" in their 2019 Annual 

Report. Additionally, Ryanair and easyJet appear to support including international (EU to/from non-EU) 

flights alongside intra-EU flights in a SAF mandate.  

 In contrast to Air France-KLM, International Airlines Group, Lufthansa, and Ryanair, easyJet appears to 

have a more progressive, mixed stance on numerous EU climate policies. easyJet has stated support for 

the inclusion of intra-EU flights, but not international (non-EU to/from EU) flights, in the EU ETS in its 

2020 Annual Report. FOI requests from InfluenceMap also uncover that in private 2019 emails to the 

EU Commission easyJet stated that “if a tax is needed, it must be directly linked to GHG – i.e. a fuel tax” 

regarding climate taxes for aviation. Furthermore, while easyJet publicly urged the UK government to 

suspend the Air Passenger Duty (APD) tax for twelve months due to the Covid-19 crisis in September 

2020 testimony to the UK government, it advocated for APD reforms to ensure flights are taxed based 

on their carbon emissions per journey.  

 The next five largest airlines by GHG emissions in this analysis (Virgin Atlantic, Scandinavian Airlines 
(SAS), TAP Air Portugal, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, and Wizz Air) have limited disclosure and low 

direct engagement with European climate-related regulations, although all but Wizz Air retain 

memberships to either IATA or A4E. Evidence collected by InfluenceMap does suggest some 

engagement with regional policies in Europe, for example SAS and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA have 

communicated opposition to national ticket taxes in Sweden and Norway,  

 There is likewise limited transparency regarding the EU policy engagement activities of Boeing and 

Airbus, despite the significance of the companies to delivering a low-carbon transition for aviation. 

Both Boeing and Airbus have communicated high-level support for climate action on aviation 

emissions, particularly emphasizing the importance of global policy actions via ICAO. However, both 

companies also appear to have shared European airlines’ positions on regional and national regulations.

For example, Airbus appears to have joined Air-France KLM in using the COVID-19 crisis to lobby EU 

officials in private meetings and emails in 2021 to subsidize new aircraft purchases through a "green 

stimulus” scheme (explained in the following chapter) while Boeing expressed similar concerns to 

Lufthansa and other airlines regarding a stringent EU SAF mandate in a 2020 consultation response. 

 Furthermore, both Airbus and Boeing are members of IATA and A4E.  The companies also retain 

memberships to other powerful cross-sector industry associations InfluenceMap has found to be highly 

oppositional to ambitious climate policy in the US and Europe including the National Association of 

Manufacturers (Boeing) and the US Chamber of Commerce (Boeing) and the Federation of German 

Industries (Airbus) and Mouvement des Entreprises de France (Airbus). 

Airline Coordination Platform  
Alongside major industry associations, companies also often strategically employ professional, external 
public affairs agencies to privately influence climate regulations. The Airline Coordination Platform is a 
Brussels-focused lobbying organization, which appears to be run through a consultancy firm, with 
national, "legacy” airline members including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, and TAP Air 
Portugal. While the Airline Coordination Platform appears to have previously focused competition law 
issues for airlines, during the COVID-19 crisis, it appears to have focused on lobbying EU climate policy.  

New documents, uncovered by InfluenceMap freedom of information requests, reveal that the Airline 
Coordination Platform has written climate policy papers directly emailed to EU Commission officials by 
Lufthansa. These documents include a December 2020 position paper on the ‘Greening of European 
Aviation’ which states top-line support for the EU's climate neutrality 2050 objective and specifies that 
policies measures to enforce the Green Deal should apply to all airlines serving the European Market and 
compensated by third country airlines via a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. 

However, the group appears unsupportive of stringent near-term action to reduce GHG emissions. It 
argues that distortions like carbon leakage will continue "as long as regional instruments, such as the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), remain in place". This position paper advocates for policies including 
an increased free allocation of EU ETS allowances for airlines operating feeder flights (flights to hub 
airports from destinations not served by larger airlines). This would likely weaken the scheme’s emissions 
reduction potential. Moreover, the position paper appears unsupportive of a sustainable aviation fuels 
(SAFs) mandate, arguing that “given that the high price of SAFs remain, the blending mandates as 
currently being discussed would adversely impact the competitiveness of EU airlines.”. It also urges the 
Commission to use EU ETS auction revenues to subsidize SAFs and/or exempt feeder flights from an 
EU-wide SAF mandate, and for SAF mandates to be dealt with only at a global level.  

The December 2020 paper further argues “an EU kerosene tax will not reduce emissions – the opposite 
effect may occur”, opposing both EU-level and national jet fuel taxes and later stressing that a jet fuel tax 
“would have a negative impact on the profitability of certain routes, leading to a reduction of 
connectivity if such routes could no longer be served profitably”. Lastly, while the paper argues to 
promote rail as an alternative to short-haul flights, it suggests banning short-haul flights is 
"counterproductive", and advocates to “stop levying airlines and using the revenues to subsidize 
domestic state-operated rail transport”, suggesting opposition to aviation ticket taxes.  

In an October 2020 EU consultation response, the Airline Coordination Platform similarly emphasized 
concerns around costs, and the risks of “tankering” regarding an EU SAF mandate, suggesting an 
unsupportive position, and advocated for an exemption for intra-EU feeder flights from the EU ETS.

The Lobbying Strategy of Europe’s Aviation Sector 
This chapter outlines the key lobbying and influencing strategies employed by the European aviation sector on 

climate change, including their lobbying strategies, disclosed EU lobbying spend and public relations narratives. 

 

Aviation Industry Lobbying Strategy 
The European aviation industry has employed three key strategic narratives to collectively delay, weaken 

and block ambitious climate legislation for aviation at national, EU, and global levels, in addition to lobbying 

directly against specific climate regulations. 

The Aviation Sector’s Climate Policy Strategy Explained  

 
 
 
 



            

Aviation Industry and European Climate Policy, June 2021

The Aviation Sector Supports Net-Zero EU Emissions by 2050 - While Opposing 
Specific Near-Term EU and National Regulations to Reduce Emissions  
InfluenceMap’s analysis on climate-related lobbying has identified an increasingly common industry 

strategy to support long-term net-zero targets while opposing specific Paris-aligned near-term policy 

measures to achieve them. The European aviation industry has fully embraced this tactic, strategically 

delaying ambitious climate regulation for aviation while hiding near-term inaction on decarbonization.  

 In February 2021, the European aviation industry (including Airlines for Europe) announced sector-wide 

support, as part of the Destination 2050 Initiative, for net-zero aviation emissions from all flights within, 

and departing the EU, UK, and EFTA by 2050. The report was released during key EU deliberations on 

climate regulation for aviation, and was emailed to EU Commission officials pre-release in February 

2021 by Airlines for Europe, who stated that “in the current crisis the industry is finding itself, the 

strategic significance of such commitments cannot be underestimated”. However, the report’s key 

commitments do not appear to outline support for any specific, ambitious near-term climate policies to 

decarbonize the sector.  

 Simultaneously, the European aviation industry has actively and collectively lobbied against nearly all 

strands of specific European climate regulation for aviation, including all climate-related taxation for 

aviation. For example, Airlines for Europe, Europe's leading aviation industry association, in an April 

2020 EU consultation response argued that "climate policy regulation in the form of sector-specific 

taxes, levies or bans are ecologically and economically counterproductive". Similarly, statements from 

airline CEOs in 2019-20 including International Airlines Group, Ryanair, and Air France-KLM appear to 

oppose climate-related aviation taxes, disputing their environmental benefits, with an Air France paper 

emailed to EU Commission officials in March 2021 arguing “new taxation must be avoided”.  

Support Weak, Global Climate Regulations only - the CORSIA Offsetting Scheme 
Alongside strategically lobbying against all Paris-aligned EU-level and national-level climate regulations, 

the aviation industry has urged the EU to prioritize global-only aviation climate policy that relies on 

offsetting over reducing the sector’s absolute GHG emissions. This includes supporting the replacement of 

the EU ETS with CORSIA, while also lobbying to weaken the CORSIA offsetting scheme at a global level. 

This is despite EU Commission analysis that European participation in CORSIA over the EU ETS would 

achieve little more than a scenario “in which international aviation emissions remain unregulated”. This two-

point strategy to disable climate policy for aviation in Europe is outlined below. 

 European-level: At a European level, Airlines for Europe have advocated that CORSIA replaces more 

ambitious EU and national-level climate regulations in EU consultation responses. In EU consultations, 

A4E argued in October 2020 that "regional climate solutions risk shifting GHG at the expense of airlines 

based in the region", further stating in an August 2020 consultation response that "all national and 

regional policy on aviation emissions must now be done with the utmost care to align with and support

CORSIA". Companies have also directly lobbied aviation climate policy in Europe. In March 2021 emails 

to EU Commission officials, Air France advocated for a “full and proper implementation of CORSIA”, 

and in a 2020 EU consultation response Lufthansa urged the EU to apply CORSIA “in its full scope”. 

Similarly, International Airlines Group’s 2020 CDP response discloses that “we are also actively 

lobbying UK and EU Governments on the issue that CORSIA should replace aviation’s inclusion in the 

EU ETS”. Regarding CORSIA they further disclose that “IAG has actively supported negotiations to 

secure ‘CORSIA’” at ICAO, and have “sent delegations to participate in the negotiations in ICAO as part 

of our industry trade association IATA’s delegation”.  

 Global-level: At a global level, IATA, of which eight of the twelve aviation companies analyzed in this 

report remain a member (see Appendix 1) has lobbied for the CORSIA offsetting strategy to be “the only 

market-based measure applied to international flights”, opposing all other regional and national climate 

regulations for aviation. In Europe during the COVID-19 crisis, IATA urged the EU in an August 2020 

consultation response to support CORSIA over more ambitious regional climate measures, and in 

September 2020 argued that national and regional climate regulations for aviation, such as a French 

ticket tax on flights, "could jeopardize CORSIA". In 2020 IATA also led lobbying efforts to weaken the 

CORSIA offsetting scheme (see box below).   

IATA and the CORSIA Offsetting Scheme 
At a global level, during the COVID-19 crisis, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) led 

efforts at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to change CORSIA’s baseline year from the 

average emissions of 2019-20, to solely 2019. The change was first proposed in a March 2020 IATA 

position paper, after a pandemic-driven dramatic decline in air travel. Alongside lobbying a senior ICAO 

official in April 2020 to support the baseline change, new evidence uncovered in an FOI request by 

InfluenceMap reveals IATA lobbied EU officials in a private April 2020 meeting for their support. 

Following intensive lobbying, in June 2020 ICAO agreed to change the baseline date for CORSIA to 2019, 

in line with IATA’s demands.  

The baseline change date significantly reduced the emissions reduction potential of CORSIA. Under the 

new baseline, offsetting is not required until aviation's emissions increase above previous 2019 records, 

which IATA forecasts will not be until 2024, due to a worldwide air traffic decline during the COVID-19 

crisis. IATA estimated that weakening the baseline date would save airlines $15 billion in offsetting costs, 

with ICCT research finding the change would leave around 81 million tons of emissions no longer required 

to be offset.

Use the COVID-19 Crisis to Delay and Weaken Climate Regulation for Aviation 
While the ten airlines covered by this study have received €30bn in government bailouts since the beginning 

of the Covid-19 crisis without binding environmental conditions, the airline industry has used the Covid-19 

crisis to lobby to weaken and delay climate regulation for aviation in Europe in the following ways.  

 COVID-19 and European lobbying: Airlines for Europe in March 2020 used COVID-19 to advocate for 

a defer or waiver new aviation taxes in a March 2020 press release, and referenced COVID-19 to justify 

not reducing free EU ETS allowances for aviation in a February 2021 EU consultation submission. 

Similarly, in March 2020, Air France-KLM CEO, Benjamin Smith, argued that “in view of the coronavirus 

outbreak, we are asking governments to suspend the introduction of new flight taxes” and in May 2020 

the Ryanair CEO, Michael O’Leary stated that “I suspect an awful lot of the environmental agenda and 

targets will be put on the back burner for a number of years” during the COVID-19 crisis. IATA also 

lobbied policymakers to provide flexibility with EU ETS compliance for the aviation industry due to 

COVID-19 in a private April 2020 meeting, and Lufthansa argued that reductions for free emissions 

allowances in the EU ETS “should only start after the COVID-19 crisis” in a November 2020 EU 

consultation response. Lastly, both IATA and A4E opposed climate conditionality attachments to 

COVID-19 related airline bailouts during the COVID-19 crisis. In April 2020, IATA's former Alexandre de 

Juniac stated, “it’s no time for requirements”, while an A4E spokesperson similarly argued that "this is 

not the time to be discussing green conditions for government support to airlines". 

 UK Air Passenger Duty: In the UK, Ryanair, easyJet, and British Airways (an IAG subsidiary) used the 

COVID-19 crisis to advocate directly to the UK government to suspend the UK air passenger duty 

(APD), a ticket tax on flights, for twelve months or more. Ryanair’s CEO, Michael O’Leary provided oral 

evidence to the UK Government in March 2021, using the Covid-19 crisis to advocate for the APD to be 

repealed “for a one or two-year period”. Similarly, easyJet supported the repeal of the Air Passenger 

Duty for twelve months in September 2020 in a UK parliamentary committee meeting. In September 

2020, the CEO of British Airways, an IAG subsidiary, urged the government to suspend the APD for “a 

minimum of a 12-month period” for domestic travel in a parliamentary committee meeting. Following 

such advocacy, the UK government announced plans to cut the UK air passenger duty on domestic flights 

in March 2021.  

 EU subsidies for new aircraft: Airbus and Air-France KLM also appear to have directly used the COVID-

19 crisis to lobby EU Commission officials in private meetings and emails in 2021 to subsidize new 

aircraft purchases for airlines through a "green stimulus” scheme. In documents accessed by 

InfluenceMap from FOI requests Air France argued for a green stimulus subsidy scheme for new aircraft 

that "should at least be allowed in the context of the EU Taxonomy and the EIB lending policy". 

Similarly, in a February 2021 meeting with the EU Commission, an Airbus presentation advocated for EU 

policymakers to support an "aircraft fleet renewable" scheme as part of a "green stimulus", including 

through the EU's taxonomy, that would provide “post C19 crisis support to airlines”.

Aviation Spending on Climate Lobbying 
Comprehensive spending disclosures from companies on climate lobbying and PR activities from the 

aviation sector across Europe are limited. However, companies and industry associations lobbying EU 

regulations are legally required to disclose their estimated annual lobbying costs related to the EU 

Transparency Register. However, such data has numerous limitations. It does not disclose the proportion of 

overall lobbying costs spent on climate-related regulations and excludes lobbying costs in national states or 

at a global level. Moreover, it does not include spending on public relations, advertising, and other 

influencing activities defined as policy engagement according to the UN Guide for Responsible Corporate 

Engagement in Climate Policy.  

However, EU Transparency registry data does provide a limited indication of the scale at which the aviation 

industry is actively lobbying EU regulations, including on climate change. In its 2020 Annual Report, Air-

France KLM disclosed a €2.75 million global "expenditure for policy influence" in 2019, with "the majority of 

these costs relate to memberships of national and international trade associations". However, Air France-

KLM only disclosed a 2019 lobbying spend in the EU Transparency Register of between €400,000 - 

€499,999 relating to EU activities, with this figure doubling to €900,000 - €999,999 from 2019 to 2020, 

suggesting a significant increase in lobbying activities during the COVID-19 crisis.  

In total, the annual EU lobbying spend for the five largest European airlines, the two primary aircraft 

manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus), and two key industry associations (A4E and IATA) is around €6.75 

million per year (see Appendix 4 for a full breakdown). Notably, only the five largest airlines disclosed a 

lobbying spend of over €9,999 per annum, indicating that climate-related lobbying spending for aviation is 

dominated by these five companies (Air France-KLM, easyJet, International Airlines Group, Lufthansa, and 

Ryanair). 

Public Relations, Branding, and Climate Change 
InfluenceMap research (see Big Oil's Real Agenda on Climate Change, March 2019) has previously identified 

corporations have increasingly invested in PR and ad campaigns designed to link their brands to positive 

action on climate. However, simultaneously many of the industry associations they fund engage in 

lobbying largely misaligned with the Paris Agreement. Similarly, recent academic research by Robert Brulle, 

Director of Research at the Climate Social Science Network (2019) found that advertising by fossil fuel 

companies has become a dominant strategy to influence climate policy through manipulating the public 

narrative on climate.  

The European aviation industry appears to have employed similar advertising and PR strategies and 

narratives to Big Oil to suggest the sector has been contributing to climate action, while simultaneously 

lobbying against Paris-aligned regulation for aviation. Three key public relations strategies found by this 

study employed for the aviation industry to link their brands to positive action include.

Aviation Industry and European Climate Policy, June 2021

 'Green’ flights: Although aviation in Europe is the most carbon-intensive form of transport, with EU GHG 

emissions from international aviation more than doubling since 1990, many airline companies are 

attempting to rebrand flights as 'green' or low-carbon. Notably, two major European airline advertising 

campaigns were stopped by regulators for misleading consumers over their "green" credentials in 

2020. In the UK, an ad campaign that claimed Ryanair was Europe's "lowest emissions airline" was 

banned for being misleading, and Ryanair's website in 2021 still claims to be "Europe's greenest" airline. 

In June 2020, KLM was also ordered by the Dutch advertising regulator to change its advertising campaign 

for misleading consumers on the scale of its biofuel use.  

 Prioritizing offsets over real-world GHG emissions reductions. The European aviation industry has 

consistently promoted the importance of offsetting schemes like CORSIA in their messaging, rather 

than reducing their absolute GHG emissions reductions at source, while other sectors such as electricity 

have seen rapid decarbonization since 1990. European airlines appear to be strategically embracing 

offsets to green their public image at low cost while simultaneously increasing the number of European 

flights they operate each year, and therefore their direct GHG emissions. In Europe, while some airlines 

like Lufthansa encourage passengers to offset their flights, others like easyJet or British Airways, purchase 

offset credits to cover many or all of their flights. 

 However, a major investigation in May 2021 found that offset credits used by European airlines 

including British Airways and easyJet were sometimes "not fit for purpose", overstated emissions 

reductions, and resulted in "phantom carbon credits" that did little for climate action. Similarly, in 2020 

Ryanair dropped two carbon offset schemes funded by passengers after criticisms they failed to reduce 

real-world GHG emissions. Such offsetting schemes have been further criticized by major airlines, with 

the CEO of United Airlines arguing in March 2021 that "the truth is that most carbon offsets aren’t even 

real". 

 

IATA and the FlyAware Campaign 

At a global level, IATA coordinates the Fly Aware campaign, first announced in 2019 to counter the 'flight 

shaming' movement weakening demand for air travel in Europe. An InfluenceMap FOI request from a 

2020 International Airlines Group meeting with the EU Commission revealed that the FlyAware website 

was being developed by IATA to "inform the public on the environmental impact of aviation in a 

nuanced way, as they see the flygskam movement as potentially damaging and unfair to the sector". 

FlyAware promotes the role of flyers in reducing aviation emissions – “From offsetting your flights 

emissions to packing lighter, you can already make some simple changes to reduce your own carbon 

footprint when you fly", attempting to strategically shift the cost and responsibility of GHG emissions 

reductions to consumers.

Aviation Industry and European Climate Policy, June 2021

 Flying as a social good: Low-cost European carriers like Ryanair and easyJet, are increasingly employing 

arguments around inequality to push back against climate regulation and secure the aviation industry a 

social license for unconditional growth. For example, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary in March 2021 

stated that the UK Air Departure Tax for flights "is regressive, and it hits the poorest people hardest". 

Similarly, easyJet's CEO, Johan Lundgren, argued in 2020 “if people connect less, if there’s less mobility 

in the world, the higher the inequality” in response to proposals to reduce flying in Europe.  

 Research however indicates that growing European aviation emissions are strongly linked to wealthy, 

frequent fliers. A 2020 academic study found that only 2-4 % of the global population flew 

internationally in 2018, with wealthy frequent flyers that represented 1% of the world population 

emitting 50% of GHG from commercial aviation in 2018. Similarly, a 2021 Possible study found such 

trends mirrored within European states, like in France, where 2% of the population take 50% of all 

flights, and that frequent fliers tend to have higher incomes. Similarly, in the UK, 70% of all flights are 

made by a wealthy 15% of the population, with 57% not flying at all. Consequently, climate-related 

regulations for aviation are likely to impose greater costs on globally wealthy households.

EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) 

Industry Association Position Evidence 

Airlines for Europe 
(A4E) 

Negative 

In 2020-21, Airlines for Europe (A4E) stated opposition to including international (EEA 
to/from non-EEA) flights in the EU ETS and questioned the legality of extending the EU 
ETS to international non-EEA flights in multiple EU consultation responses. Furthermore, 
evidence suggests A4E supports replacing the current inclusion of intra-EEA flights (EEA 
to/from EEA) in the EU ETS with a hybrid system that includes both the EU ETS and CORSIA 
offsetting scheme. In a January 2021 consultation, A4E has also appeared to oppose other 
measures to strengthen the EU ETS. In a February 2021 consultation response, A4E 
further supported the continued free emissions allocation of permits for aviation in the EU 
ETS, stating that “free allocation and a possible Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism 
(CBAM) must be complementary”. 

International Air 
Transport 

Association (IATA) 
Negative 

In a private meeting with EU DG Transport staff in February 2020, IATA asserted that it 
viewed the EU ETS "as endangering CORSIA", called on the "EU to show full support to 
CORSIA". Similarly, in its 2020 response to the EU ETS consultation, IATA opposed the 
application of the EU ETS to aviation, questioned its legality, rejected a reduction in free 
aviation emissions allowances, and supported replacing it with CORSIA. Additionally, in a 
private meeting with the EU Commission in April 2020, IATA lobbied policymakers to 
provide flexibility with EU ETS compliance for the aviation industry due to Covid-19. 

Airline Position Evidence 

Air France-KLM Negative 

In an August 2020 consultation response, Air France-KLM advocated for CORSIA to replace 
international (EU to/from non-EU) flights in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) 
and stated "the option of exempting intra-EU feeder flights from EU ETS to rebalance the 
playing field should in particular be assessed by the Commission." In the same consultation 
response, they also opposed a reduction for free emissions allowances for aviation in the 
EU ETS and supported the exemption of intra-EU feeder flights from the EU ETS. In a 
March 2021 policy paper emailed to the EU Commission, Air-France KLM appeared to 
oppose reducing free emissions allowances for aviation in the EU ETS and supported the 
“full and proper implementation of CORSIA". Similarly, in its 2020 public policy 
position statement, Air France-KLM argued that participation in CORSIA should exempt the 
sector from policies including the EU ETS. Air France-KLM further disclosed through its 
2020 CDP disclosure that it "expects CORSIA to be the only measure applicable to 
emissions from international flights within Europe in the future." 

International 
Airlines Group (IAG) 

Negative 

IAG's 2020 CDP response disclosed that it is "actively lobbying UK and EU Governments 
on the issue that CORSIA should replace aviation’s inclusion in the EU ETS." Similarly, a 
2019 presentation from IAG communicated that it is lobbying to repeal the EU ETS and 
replace it with CORSIA.

Aviation Industry and European Climate Policy, June 2021  

 

30 

Lufthansa Negative 

In multiple EU consultation responses in 2020, Lufthansa advocated against reducing free 
emissions allowances for aviation and opposed the inclusion of international (EEA to/from 
non-EEA) flights in the EU ETS with an unclear position on including intra-EU flights in the 
EU ETS scope. Additionally, in a January 2021 email to the Vice-President of the European 
Green Deal, Lufthansa advocated for intra-EU feeder flights (flights to hub airports from 
destinations not served by larger airlines) to be exempt from the EU ETS. Similarly, a 2019 
policy brief from Lufthansa criticized the “competitive disadvantage” of the EU ETS for 
aviation, asserting that “a way must be found to coordinate the ETS and CORSIA optimally 
in order to avoid dual burdens on European airlines”. 

Ryanair Negative 
In a 2021 EU consultation response, Ryanair appeared unsupportive of reducing free 
emissions allowances for aviation in the EU ETS and argued increased carbon leakage 
protection should be provided for “sectors most at risk”.  

easyJet Mixed 

In its 2020 Annual Report, easyJet advocates for intra-EU flights to remain in the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), and that international (EU to/from non-EU) flights 
“should remain in CORSIA to support global efforts, but with an obligation equivalent to 
that of the EU ETS”.

Kerosene jet fuel taxation 

Industry Association Position Evidence 

Airlines for Europe 
(A4E) 

Negative 

A4E stated vocal opposition to a jet fuel tax for aviation in a 2020 EU consultation, further 
arguing in an October 2020 policy paper that a fuel tax would “reduce the global 
competitiveness of European airlines”. Additionally, in a March 2020 press release, A4E 
advocated for a moratorium on new aviation taxation during the Covid-19 crisis. A4E’s 
Managing Director, Thomas Reynaert also argued in a February 2020 media piece that “not 
one single study” shows that ticket or fuel taxes impact passenger behavior enough to “very 
much decrease” aircraft traffic.  

International Air 
Transport Association 

(IATA) 
Negative 

In a 2020 EU consultation, IATA opposed the introduction of an EU jet fuel tax to help 
decarbonize aviation.  

Airline Position Evidence 

Air France-KLM Negative 

Air France-KLM appeared to oppose an EU jet fuel tax in an April 2020 EU consultation 
response, stating that “measures that merely add costs and do not help us in this green 
transition such as additional national or European fuel, CO2 or ticket taxes must be avoided”. 
Furthermore, a policy paper emailed by Air France-KLM to the EU Commission in March 
2021 opposed ending the fuel tax exemption for aviation in the EU.

Aviation Industry and European Climate Policy, June 2021  

 

31 

International Airlines 
Group (IAG) 

Negative  
A 2019 media report from the Wall Street Journal stated that International Airlines Group 
reportedly opposed an EU-wide jet fuel tax. 

Lufthansa Negative 

Lufthansa’s “key messages on climate policy” website statement in 2021 appears to oppose a 
national jet fuel tax, arguing it would distort competition. Lufthansa also opposed a potential 
German tax on jet fuel in a 2019 policy brief, stating that it would weaken Germany’s position 
as an aviation hub without gaining any significant environmental benefit. A 2019 media report 
from the Wall Street Journal stated that Lufthansa reportedly opposed an EU-wide jet fuel 
tax. 

Ryanair Negative 

In a 2020 EU consultation response, Ryanair stated “taxing kerosene and other aviation fuels 
for intra EU flights would be counterproductive because of the risk of “tankering””, suggesting 
opposition to an EU jet fuel tax. A 2019 report from the Irish Times stated that Ryanair 
reportedly opposed an EU-wide jet fuel tax, with Ryanair asserting that any such tax would 
be “very damaging for Ireland”. In 2019, Ryanair CEO, Michael O’Leary, further argued that 
“fuel taxes damage EU competitiveness and distort traffic flows” in a press 
conference. Similarly, in 2019 O’Leary reportedly stated opposition to “a bunch of f**king 
Dutch people telling us to pay more taxes” before a meeting with the EU Transport 
Commissioner that included taxation discussions. While Ryanair’s chief marketing officer in 
2019 appeared to support a tax on jet fuel over the EU ETS in an interview, a Ryanair 
statement clarified that “it favors no new taxes at all”. 

easyJet Mixed 

Evidence included in private letters from easyJet to the EU Commission suggest potential 
support for a jet fuel tax, stating in November 2019 that “if a tax is needed, it must be directly 
linked to CO2 – i.e. a fuel tax”, In February 2020, an easyJet private email to the EU 
Commission stated that “I would like to share thoughts with you on […] ensuring that 
European aviation reaches its environmental objectives for 2050 - including how this could 
involve taxation, in particular a fuel tax on kerosene”. However, meeting notes from 
December 2019 between easyJet and the EU Commission suggest an unsupportive position 
for an EU fuel tax, with easyJet criticizing the level of taxes paid by them in Europe and the 
“wrong belief that aviation is exempted to tax due to no tax on kerosene”. Additionally, a 
2019 article from the Wall Street Journal suggested easyJet reportedly opposed an EU-wide 
tax on jet fuel.

quick fixes (e.g., ticket taxes) to pressing and complex environmental challenges". In 2019, 
A4E further stated specific opposition to a Netherlands ticket tax on Twitter and in 2020 its 
Managing Director appeared unsupportive of the UK Air Passenger Duty in a November 2020 
media interview.  

International Air 
Transport Association 

(IATA) 
Negative 

In 2019-20, IATA communications have stated vocal opposition to ticket taxes on aviation, 
including in Switzerland and France. Furthermore, in 2019, IATA’s former CEO, Alexandre de 
Juniac, specifically stated opposition to a German ticket tax for aviation, arguing that “taxes 
are not the way to cover our environmental costs”. Similarly, in a 2019 ICAO working paper, 
IATA opposed the introduction of any ticket taxes in states covered by CORSIA. 

Airline Position Evidence 

Air France-KLM Negative 

In 2019-20, Air France-KLM opposed a ticket tax for aviation in France, according to a 
2019 press release and a 2020 Reuters article, while Forbes in 2020 reported that Air France-
KLM appeared to oppose a Dutch ticket tax for aviation. Air France-KLM further disclosed 
opposition to “jet fuel taxation, carbon taxation and/or ticket taxation” for aviation in France 
and the Netherlands in its 2020 CDP response. In March 2020, Air France’s CEO, Benjamin 
Smith, also argued that “in view of the coronavirus outbreak, we are asking governments to 
suspend the introduction of new flight taxes”. 

International Airlines 
Group (IAG) 

Negative 

In March 2020, an IAG spokesperson supported repealing the UK Air Passenger Duty, a ticket 
tax on flights, in media communication. In evidence provided to the British parliament in 
September 2020, the CEO of British Airways, an IAG subsidiary, appeared to advocate for 
the UK Air Passenger Duty (APD) tax to be suspended for at least twelve months for 
domestic travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a 2019 presentation, IAG also 
appeared unsupportive of other national European ticket taxes on flights. 

Lufthansa Negative  

In 2021 website communications, Lufthansa stated opposition to a German air ticket tax and 
national jet fuel taxes. Similarly, in 2020 a Lufthansa spokesperson stressed competitiveness 
concerns to argue against increasing the German aviation tax, In 2020, Swiss Airlines (a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Lufthansa) publicly opposed a ticket tax on Swiss flights. 
Lufthansa’s CEO, Carsten Spohr further stated opposition to national-level taxes on aviation 
in a 2019 interview and argued that similar EU-wide measures would harm competition. 

Ryanair Negative 

Ryanair’s 2019 ‘Environmental Policy’ report states opposition to airline ticket taxes in the 
Netherlands, France, and Ireland, with Ryanair also urging Portugal to scrap a proposed air 
travel eco-tax in November 2020 on Twitter. In March 2021, Ryanair’s CEO, Michael O’Leary 
provided oral evidence to the UK Government, using the Covid-19 crisis to justify 
advocating for the UK air passenger duty tax to be repealed “for a one or two-year period”, 
after Ryanair called for its suspension previously in a June 2020 media statement. In a 2019 
press conference, Michael O’Leary stated opposition to a French ticket tax on aviation, 
also arguing in 2020 that “we would like to see the removal of rights of EU governments to 
use aviation as a tax grab against consumers”.  

easyJet Negative 

In August 2020, easyJet publicly urged the UK government to suspend the Air Passenger 
Duty (APD) tax for twelve months due to the Covid-19 crisis. This recommendation was 
further repeated by easyJet in a September 2020 testimony to the UK government, while 
also arguing for APD reforms to ensure flights are taxed based on their carbon emissions per 
journey. A media statement from easyJet in 2020 also communicated opposition to a Dutch 
ticket tax, while in 2019 easyJet’s CEO, Johan Lundgren, criticized the Danish ticket tax on 
flights in a private meeting with the UK Transport Secretary. In a 2019 private letter to the 
EU Commission, easyJet stated support for ticket tax reforms to better ensure taxes are 
linked to their carbon emissions and supported ending exemptions for transfer passengers, 
private aviation, and cargo flights under such taxes.

SAS communicated opposition to ticket taxes for aviation in Sweden and Norway in its 2020 
Sustainability Report. 

TAP Air Portugal Undisclosed N/A

Sustainable aviation fuels mandate 

Industry Association Position Evidence 

Airlines for Europe 
(A4E) 

Mixed 

Airlines for Europe argued in a 2020 consultation that a SAF mandate should only be 
considered under “mature market conditions”, suggesting an unsupportive position. 
Similarly, A4E’s Managing Director, Thomas Reynaert, stated in 2020 that regarding SAFs, 
“such legislation needs to prioritize additional incentives for aviation, instead of putting in 
place compulsory mandates for blending irrespective of price, production volumes or 
competitiveness considerations”. However, in November 2020, as part of the Aviation 
Round Table report, A4E appeared to endorse an EU SAF blending mandate. 

International Air 
Transport Association 

(IATA) 
Mixed 

IATA also appeared unsupportive of an EU blending mandate for Sustainable Aviation Fuels 
(SAFs) in a 2020 EU consultation response, emphasizing cost concerns. Furthermore, in a 
February 2020 meeting with EU DG Transport officials, IATA stressed that blending 
mandates may affect EU airline competitiveness. However, in March 2021 comments in 
Euractiv, IATA appeared to take a more mixed position, supporting an EU SAF mandate “to 
intra-EU flights only in the first phase, with a potential to be extended in a second phase”.  

Airline Position Evidence 

Air France-KLM Mixed 

In an October 2020 response to the RefuelEU consultation, Air France-KLM took an unclear 
position on an EU SAF mandate. In March 2021, Air-France KLM appeared unsupportive of an 
EU SAF mandate in a policy paper sent to EU Commission officials, arguing it should only be 
introduced in a “mature market” and “should not be imposed if high-quality SAF is still too 
scarce in Europe”.  

International Airlines 
Group (IAG) Mixed 

In its 2019 Annual Report, International Airlines Group disclosed that they are “lobbying to 
prevent mandates […] at an EU and UK level” on sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), arguing 
they should only apply at a global level. In its April 2020 response to the RefuelEU 
consultation, IAG stressed that an EU-wide blending SAF mandate would cause competitive 
distortion, urging policymakers to only include intra-EU (EU to/from EU states) flights in a 
potential mandate. However, IAG in October 2020 appeared to endorse an EU-wide SAF 
blending mandate through its endorsement of a Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative strategy 
on European aviation. 

Lufthansa Negative 

In March 2020 Lufthansa’s CEO argued that European regulations on SAFs should not “push 
us into mandated fuels unless it is done worldwide, otherwise it decreases the 
competitiveness of European airlines”. Similarly, in an October RefuelEU consultation 
response, Lufthansa stated regarding SAFs that “instead of a mandate, a feed-in tariff could 
help to differentiate between technologies and level the costs”. However, in October 2020, 
as part of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative, Lufthansa appeared to endorse an EU SAF 
blending mandate. Yet in private emails to EU Commission officials in January and February

2021, Lufthansa appeared unsupportive of a SAF mandate, emphasizing “competitiveness 
issues”. 

Ryanair Mixed 

In a March 2020 EU consultation response, Ryanair emphasized cost and competitiveness 
concerns to “strongly advise against introducing mandates on Sustainable Aviation Fuels 
(SAFs) in the nearest future.” In an October 2020 EU consultation response, Ryanair stressed 
cost concerns around a SAF mandate while arguing it should apply to international (non-EU 
to/from EU) flights alongside intra-EU flights. Similarly, in March 2021, Ryanair signed a joint 
letter to policymakers that opposed excluding long-haul flights from an EU SAF mandate. 

easyJet Mixed 

In a 2020 response to the EU Refuel consultation, easyJet stated support for an EU 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) mandate with the exception that it only applies to only 
long-haul flights over 1500km. Similarly, in March 2021 easyJet signed a joint letter to 
policymakers that opposed the exclusion of long-haul flights in a potential EU SAF mandate.

Wizz Air Mixed 
In March 2021, Wizz Air signed a joint letter opposing the exclusion of long-haul flights in a 
potential EU sustainable aviation fuels mandate. 

Aircraft Manufacturer Position Evidence 

Airbus Mixed 

In 2020, as part of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative, Airbus appeared to endorse an EU 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending mandate alongside other measures to increase 
European SAF supply and demand. However, in a 2020 EU consultation response to the 
Refuel EU initiative on sustainable aviation fuels, Airbus appeared to take an unclear 
position regarding an EU SAF mandate.  

Boeing Mixed 

Boeing appeared to oppose an EU mandate for sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) in an April 
2020 consultation response, citing competitiveness concerns. Similarly, in an October 2020 
RefuelEU consultation response, Boeing stated “we caution against imposing a minimum 
share of sustainable fuel in the form of mandates”, arguing that “without mechanisms to 
advance production and R&D, a blending mandate is premature”. However, Boeing in 
October 2020, as part of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative, appeared to endorse an EU 
SAF mandate.
