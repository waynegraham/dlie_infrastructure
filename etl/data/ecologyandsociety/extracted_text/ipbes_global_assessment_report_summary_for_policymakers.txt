FOREWORD

A 
key objective of the Intergovernmental 
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity 
and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is to 
provide Governments, the private sector 
and civil society with scientifically credible 
and independent up-to-date assessments 

of available knowledge for better evidence-informed policy 
decisions and action at the local, national, regional and 
global levels.

This Global Assessment of Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services has been carried out by about 150 selected experts 
from all regions of the world, including 16 early career fellows, 
assisted by 350 contributing authors. More than 15,000 
scientific publications were analyzed as well as a substantive 
body of indigenous and local knowledge. Its chapters were 
accepted, and its summary for policymakers was approved, 
by the more than 130 Governments that constitute the 
Members of IPBES, at the seventh session of the IPBES 
Plenary (29th April to 4th May, 2019), hosted by France at 
UNESCO in Paris.

This report represents a critical assessment, the first in almost 
15 years (since the release of the Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment in 2005) and the first ever carried out by an 
intergovernmental body, of the status and trends of the 
natural world, the social implications of these trends, their 
direct and indirect causes, and, importantly, the actions 
that can still be taken to ensure a better future for all. These 
complex links have been assessed using a simple, yet very 
inclusive framework that should resonate with a wide range of 
stakeholders, since it recognizes diverse world views, values 
and knowledge systems. 

The concept of nature’s contributions to people, which is 
discussed in detail in chapter 1, embraces a wide range of 
descriptions of human-nature interactions, including through 
the concept of ecosystem services and other descriptions, 
which range from strongly utilitarian to strongly relational. The 
concept of nature’s contribution to people was developed to 
embrace a fuller and more symmetric consideration of diverse 
stakeholders and world views, and a richer evidence base 
for action, i.e., the knowledge base offered by the natural 
and social sciences, the humanities, and the knowledge of 
practitioners and indigenous and local communities. The 
reporting system for nature’s contributions to people has a 
gradient of complementary and overlapping approaches, 
ranging from a generalizing to a context-specific perspective. 
The generalizing perspective is analytical in purpose and is 
organized into eighteen categories of material, non-material 
and regulating contributions. The context-specific perspective 

IPBES is an independent intergovernmental body 
comprising over 130 member Governments. 
Established by Governments in 2012, IPBES 
provides policymakers with objective scientific 
assessments about the state of knowledge 
regarding the planet’s biodiversity, ecosystems and 
the contributions they make to people, as well as 
options and actions to protect and sustainably use 
these vital natural assets.
 
The IPBES Global Assessment of Biodiversity 
and Ecosystem Services represents the landmark 
product of the first work programme of IPBES 
(2014-2018). The Global Assessment was initiated 
following a decision from the IPBES Plenary at its 
fourth session (IPBES 4, Kuala Lumpur, 2016), and 
considered by the IPBES Plenary at its seventh 
session (IPBES 7, Paris, 2019). It is composed of a 
summary for policymakers, which was approved at 
IPBES 7, and six chapters, which were accepted at 
IPBES 7.

is typical of indigenous and local knowledge 
systems, where knowledge production does 
not typically seek to explicitly extend or validate 
itself beyond specific geographic and cultural 
contexts. In this way, the nature’s contributions 
to people approach (or the IPBES approach) 
builds on the existing approaches, descriptors 
and metrics used by different communities 
of practice in the search for understanding 
and solutions.

In the last 10-15 years, since the Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment, there has been a significant increase in our 
understanding of biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as their 
importance to the quality of life of every person. There is also 
greater understanding now about which policies, practices, 
technologies and behaviors can best lead to the conservation 
and sustainable use of biodiversity and the achievement 
of many of the Sustainable Development Goals, the Aichi 
Biodiversity Targets and the Paris Agreement on Climate 
Change. However, biodiversity is still being lost, ecosystems 
are still being degraded and many of nature’s contributions to 
people are being compromised. 

The Assessment is critical today because evidence has 
accumulated that the multiple threats to biodiversity have 
intensified since previous reports, and that the sustainable use 
of nature will be vital for adapting to and mitigating dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system, as well as 
for achieving many of our most important development goals.

The findings of this Assessment focus on the global scale, 
spanning the period from the 1970s to 2050. They are based 
on an unprecedented collection of evidence, integrating 
natural and social science perspectives, a range of knowledge 
systems and multiple dimensions of value. This is the first 
global-level assessment to systematically consider evidence 
about the contributions of indigenous and local knowledge 
and practices, and issues concerning Indigenous Peoples and 
Local Communities. All these features result in a more holistic 
assessment of indirect drivers as root causes of changes 
in nature and the associated risks to the quality of life of 
all people.

As the Chair and the Executive Secretary of IPBES, we wish to 
recognize the excellent and dedicated work of the co-chairs, 
Professors Sandra Díaz (Argentina), Eduardo S. Brondízio 
(Brazil and USA), and Josef Settele (Germany) and of all 
the coordinating lead authors, lead authors, review editors, 
fellows, contributing authors and reviewers, and to warmly 
thank them for their commitment, and for contributing their 

time freely to this important report. We would also like to thank 
Hien Ngo and Maximilien Guèze from the technical support 
unit located at the IPBES secretariat in Bonn, Germany, 
because this report would not have been possible without 
their extraordinary dedication. Our thanks also go the current 
and former members of the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel 
(MEP) and of the Bureau who provided guidance as part of 
the management committee for this report, and to members 
of other technical support units within the IPBES secretariat, 
who have supported the production of this report. We would 
also like to thank all Governments and other institutions that 
provided financial and in-kind support for the preparation of 
this assessment.

The IPBES Global Assessment of Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services, together with the four IPBES regional assessments 
of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, and the two 
thematic Assessments of Pollination, Pollinators and Food 
Production, and of Land Degradation and Restoration, form 
an impressive corpus of knowledge to make better-informed 
decisions regarding the conservation and sustainable use 
of biodiversity. The IPBES Global Assessment is expected 
to be an important evidence base for the assessment of 
progress towards the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity 
Targets in the fifth edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook 
and to play a major role in the consideration of the post 2020 
biodiversity framework by the 15th Conference of the Parties 
to the Convention on Biological Diversity, in October 2020. It 
is also expected to inform implementation of the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development 
Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. It is our 
sincere hope that the IPBES Global Assessment will continue 
to place biodiversity at the top of the global political agenda, 
with similar priority to that accorded to climate change. The 
process leading to COP 15 offers this opportunity.

Nature makes human 
development possible but 
our relentless demand for 

the earth’s resources is accelerating 
extinction rates and devastating the 
world’s ecosystems. UN 
Environment is proud to support the 
Global Assessment Report 
produced by the Intergovernmental 
Science-Policy Platform on 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services because it highlights the 
critical need to integrate biodiversity 
considerations in global decision-
making on any sector or challenge, 
whether its water or agriculture, 
infrastructure or business.

Joyce Masuya

Acting Executive Director,  
United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) 

This essential report 
reminds each of us of the 
obvious truth: the present 

generations have the responsibility 
to bequeath to future generations a 
planet that is not irreversibly 
damaged by human activity. Our 
local, indigenous and scientific 
knowledge are proving that we have 
solutions and so no more excuses: 
we must live on earth differently. 
UNESCO is committed to 
promoting respect of the living and 
of its diversity, ecological solidarity 
with other living species, and to 
establish new, equitable and global 
links of partnership and 
intragenerational solidarity, for the 
perpetuation of humankind.

Audrey Azoulay

Director-General, 
United Nations Educational,  
Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) 

The Global assessment of 
biodiversity and ecosystem 
services adds a major 

element to the body of evidence for 
the importance of biodiversity to 
efforts to achieve the Zero Hunger 
objective and meet the Sustainable 
Development Goals. Together, 
assessments undertaken by IPBES, 
FAO, CBD and other organizations 
point to the urgent need for action 
to better conserve and sustainably 
use biodiversity and to the 
importance of cross-sectoral and 
multidisciplinary collaboration 
among decision-makers and other 
stakeholders at all levels.

Across cultures, humans 
inherently value nature. 
The magic of seeing 

fireflies flickering long into the night 
is immense. We draw energy and 
nutrients from nature. We find 
sources of food, medicine, 
livelihoods and innovation in 
nature. Our well-being 
fundamentally depends on nature. 
Our efforts to conserve biodiversity 
and ecosystems must be 
underpinned by the best science 
that humanity can produce. This is 
why the scientific evidence 
compiled in this IPBES Global 
Assessment is so important. It will 
help us build a stronger foundation 
for shaping the post 2020 global 
biodiversity framework: the ‘New 
Deal for Nature and People’; and 
for achieving the SDGs.

Achim Steiner 

Administrator, 
United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP)

The IPBES’ 2019 Global 
Assessment Report on 
Biodiversity and 

Ecosystem Services comes at a 
critical time for the planet and all its 
peoples. The report’s findings — 
and the years of diligent work by the 
many scientists who contributed— 
will offer a comprehensive view of 
the current conditions of global 
biodiversity. Healthy biodiversity is 
the essential infrastructure that 
supports all forms of life on earth, 
including human life. It also provides 
nature-based solutions on many of 
the most critical environmental, 
economic, and social challenges 
that we face as human society, 
including climate change, 
sustainable development, health, 
and water and food security. We are 
currently in the midst of preparing 
for the 2020 UN Biodiversity 
Conference, in China, which will 
mark the close of the Aichi 
Biodiversity Targets and set the 

course for a post 2020 ecologically 
focused sustainable development 
pathway to deliver multiple benefits 
for people, the planet and our global 
economy. The IPBES report will 
serve as a fundamental baseline of 
where we are and where we need 
to go as a global community to 
inspire humanity to reach the 2050 
Vision of the UN Biodiversity 
Convention “Living in harmony with 
nature”. I want to extend my thanks 
and congratulations to the IPBES 
community for their hard work, 
immense contributions and 
continued partnership.

he co-chairs of the IPBES Global Assessment 
Report of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 
wish to thank the people and institutions that 
helped to make the Report possible. 

We are first indebted to the hundreds of 
experts in biophysical and social sciences, policymakers 
and practitioners, as well as representatives of Indigenous 
Peoples and Local Communities, who generously 
contributed their time and knowledge, as lead authors, 
chapter scientists, resource person, and/or review editors 
(listed below), and to all contributing authors. We are 
fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with such an 
engaged, collegial and superb group of authors. 

We are grateful to the members of the IPBES secretariat, 
particularly Executive Secretary Anne Larigauderie, the 
IPBES Chair (Robert Watson), representatives of member 
States, the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel and Bureau 
and other resource persons for their dedication, strategic 
vision, constructive comments and continued advice. 
The Global Assessment would not have been possible 
without the titanic effort of its technical support unit (Hien 
T. Ngo and Maximilien Guèze) during the whole process, 
including the long and challenging seventh session of the 
IPBES Plenary (#IPBES7), which resulted in the approval 
of this Summary for Policymakers and the acceptance 
of the underlying chapters. In addition, we are thankful 
for the support of several IPBES technical support 
units, and their host institutions at different stages of the 
process: Knowledge and  data technical support unit 
(NIE, Republic of Korea), indigenous and local knowledge 
technical support unit (UNESCO), scenarios and models 
technical support unit (PBL, Netherlands), and the capacity 

building technical support unit (NEA, Norway).  We also 
thank the data visualization specialist and the graphic 
designer for their skillful work. We would like to thank the 
IPBES communications team, for their outstanding work 
communicating the main messages to the general public.  

We are also grateful to all supportive Governments but in 
particular the Governments of Germany, South Africa, Norway, 
the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands as well as 
to the Córdoba Province (Argentina), who generously hosted 
our chapter and/or author meetings. The co-chairs would 
especially like to acknowledge the support of their home 
institutions and governments: the Helmholtz Centre for 
Environmental Research – UFZ (Germany), iDiv (the German 
Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research), Universidad

KEY 
MESSAGES
A.	Nature and its vital contributions 
to people, which together embody 
biodiversity and ecosystem 
functions and services, are 
deteriorating worldwide.

Nature embodies different concepts for 
different people, including biodiversity, 
ecosystems, Mother Earth, systems of life 
and other analogous concepts. Nature’s 
contributions to people embody different 
concepts, such as ecosystem goods and 
services and nature’s gifts. Both nature and 
nature’s contributions to people are vital for 
human existence and good quality of life 
(human well-being, living in harmony with 
nature, living well in balance and harmony 
with Mother Earth, and other analogous 
concepts). While more food, energy and 
materials than ever before are now being 
supplied to people in most places, this is 
increasingly at the expense of nature’s ability 
to provide such contributions in the future, 
and frequently undermines nature’s many 
other contributions, which range from water 
quality regulation to sense of place. The 
biosphere, upon which humanity as a whole 
depends, is being altered to an unparalleled 
degree across all spatial scales. Biodiversity 
– the diversity within species, between 
species and of ecosystems – is declining 
faster than at any time in human history.

 A1 Nature is essential for human existence and 
good quality of life. Most of nature’s contributions 
to people are not fully replaceable, and some are 
irreplaceable. Nature plays a critical role in providing food 
and feed, energy, medicines and genetic resources and a 
variety of materials fundamental for people’s physical 
well-being and for maintaining culture. For example, more 
than 2 billion people rely on wood fuel to meet their primary 

energy needs, an estimated 4 billion people rely primarily on 
natural medicines for their health care and some 70 per cent 
of drugs used for cancer are natural or are synthetic 
products inspired by nature. Nature, through its ecological 
and evolutionary processes, sustains the quality of the air, 
fresh water and soils on which humanity depends, 
distributes fresh water, regulates the climate, provides 
pollination and pest control and reduces the impact of 
natural hazards. For example, more than 75 per cent of 
global food crop types, including fruits and vegetables and 
some of the most important cash crops, such as coffee, 
cocoa and almonds, rely on animal pollination. Marine and 
terrestrial ecosystems are the sole sinks for anthropogenic 
carbon emissions, with a gross sequestration of 
5.6 gigatons of carbon per year (the equivalent of some 
60 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions). Nature 
underpins all dimensions of human health and contributes to 
non-material aspects of quality of life – inspiration and 
learning, physical and psychological experiences, and 
supporting identities – that are central to quality of life and 
cultural integrity, even if their aggregated value is difficult to 
quantify. Most of nature’s contributions are co-produced 
with people, but while anthropogenic assets – knowledge 
and institutions, technology infrastructure and financial 
capital – can enhance or partially replace some of those 
contributions, some are irreplaceable. The diversity of nature 
maintains humanity’s ability to choose alternatives in the 
face of an uncertain future.

 A2 Nature’s contributions to people are often 
distributed unequally across space and time and 
among different segments of society. There are 
often trade-offs in the production and use of 
nature’s contributions. Benefits and burdens associated 
with co-production and use of nature’s contributions are 
distributed and experienced differently among social groups, 
countries and regions. Giving priority to one of nature’s 
contributions to people, such as food production, can result 
in ecological changes that reduce other contributions. Some 
of these changes may benefit some people at the expense 
of others, particularly the most vulnerable, as may changes 
in technological and institutional arrangements. For 
example, although food production today is sufficient to 
satisfy global needs, approximately 11 per cent of the 
world’s population is undernourished, and diet-related 
disease drives 20 per cent of premature mortality, related 
both to undernourishment and to obesity. The great 
expansion in the production of food, feed, fibre and 
bioenergy has occurred at the cost of many other 
contributions of nature to quality of life, including regulation 
of air and water quality, climate regulation and habitat 
provision. Synergies also exist, such as sustainable 
agricultural practices that enhance soil quality, thereby 
improving productivity and other ecosystem functions and 
services, such as carbon sequestration and water 
quality regulation.

 A3 Since 1970, trends in agricultural production, 
fish harvest, bioenergy production and harvest of 
materials have increased, but 14 of the 18 
categories of contributions of nature that were 
assessed, mostly regulating and non-material 
contributions, have declined. The value of agricultural 
crop production ($2.6 trillion in 2016) has increased 
approximately threefold since 1970 and raw timber harvest 
has increased by 45 per cent, reaching some 4 billion cubic 
metres in 2017, with the forestry industry providing about 
13.2 million jobs. However, indicators of regulating 
contributions, such as soil organic carbon and pollinator 
diversity, have declined, indicating that gains in material 
contributions are often not sustainable. Currently, land 
degradation has reduced productivity in 23 per cent of the 
global terrestrial area, and between $235 billion and 
$577 billion2 in annual global crop output is at risk as a 
result of pollinator loss. Moreover, loss of coastal habitats 
and coral reefs reduces coastal protection, which increases 
the risk from floods and hurricanes to life and property for 
the 100 million to 300 million people living within coastal 
100-year flood zones.

 A4 Nature across most of the globe has now been 
significantly altered by multiple human drivers, with 
the great majority of indicators of ecosystems and 
biodiversity showing rapid decline. Seventy-five per 
cent of the land surface is significantly altered, 66 per cent of

inflation only.

the ocean area is experiencing increasing cumulative 
impacts, and over 85 per cent of wetlands (area) has been 
lost. While the rate of forest loss has slowed globally since 
2000, this is distributed unequally. Across much of the highly 
biodiverse tropics, 32 million hectares of primary or 
recovering forest were lost between 2010 and 2015. The 
extent of tropical and subtropical forests is increasing within 
some countries, and the global extent of temperate and 
boreal forests is increasing. A range of actions – from 
restoration of natural forest to planting of monocultures 
– contributes to these increases, but these actions have very 
different consequences for biodiversity and its contributions 
to people. Approximately half the live coral cover on coral 
reefs has been lost since the 1870s, with accelerating losses 
in recent decades due to climate change exacerbating other 
drivers. The average abundance of native species in most 
major terrestrial biomes has fallen by at least 20 per cent, 
potentially affecting ecosystem processes and hence 
nature’s contributions to people; this decline has mostly 
taken place since 1900 and may be accelerating. In areas of 
high endemism, native biodiversity has often been severely 
impacted by invasive alien species. Population sizes of wild 
vertebrate species have tended to decline over the last 
50 years on land, in freshwater and in the sea. Global trends 
in insect populations are not known but rapid declines have 
been well documented in some places.

 A5 Human actions threaten more species with 
global extinction now than ever before. An average of 
around 25 per cent of species in assessed animal and plant

groups are threatened (Figure SPM.3), suggesting that 
around 1 million species already face extinction, many within 
decades, unless action is taken to reduce the intensity of 
drivers of biodiversity loss. Without such action, there will be 
a further acceleration in the global rate of species extinction, 
which is already at least tens to hundreds of times higher 
than it has averaged over the past 10 million years 
(Figure SPM.4).

 A6 Globally, local varieties and breeds of 
domesticated plants and animals are disappearing. 
This loss of diversity, including genetic diversity, 
poses a serious risk to global food security by 
undermining the resilience of many agricultural 
systems to threats such as pests, pathogens and 
climate change. Fewer and fewer varieties and breeds of 
plants and animals are being cultivated, raised, traded and 
maintained around the world, despite many local efforts, 
which include those by indigenous peoples and local 
communities. By 2016, 559 of the 6,190 domesticated 
breeds of mammals used for food and agriculture (over 9 per 
cent) had become extinct and at least 1,000 more are 
threatened. In addition, many crop wild relatives that are 
important for long-term food security lack effective 
protection, and the conservation status of wild relatives of 
domesticated mammals and birds is worsening. Reductions 
in the diversity of cultivated crops, crop wild relatives and 
domesticated breeds mean that agroecosystems are less 
resilient against future climate change, pests and pathogens.

 A7 Biological communities are becoming more 
similar to each other in both managed and 
unmanaged systems within and across regions. 
This human-caused process leads to losses of local 
biodiversity, including endemic species, ecosystem 
functions and nature’s contributions to people.

 A8 Human-induced changes are creating 
conditions for fast biological evolution – so rapid 
that its effects can be seen in only a few years or 
even more quickly. The consequences can be 
positive or negative for biodiversity and 
ecosystems, but can create uncertainty about the 
sustainability of species, ecosystem functions and 
the delivery of nature’s contributions to people. 
Understanding and monitoring these biological evolutionary 
changes is as important for informed policy decisions as it is 
in cases of ecological change. Sustainable management 
strategies then can be designed to influence evolutionary 
trajectories so as to protect vulnerable species and reduce 
the impact of unwanted species (such as weeds, pests or 
pathogens). The widespread declines in geographic 
distribution and population sizes of many species make 
clear that, although evolutionary adaptation to human-
caused drivers can be rapid, it has often not been sufficient 
to mitigate them fully.

B.	Direct and indirect drivers of 
change have accelerated during 
the past 50 years.

The rate of global change in nature during 
the past 50 years is unprecedented in 
human history. The direct drivers of change 
in nature with the largest global impact 
have been (starting with those with most 
impact): changes in land and sea use; direct 
exploitation of organisms; climate change; 
pollution; and invasion of alien species. 
Those five direct drivers result from an array 
of underlying causes – the indirect drivers of 
change – which are in turn underpinned by 
societal values and behaviours that include 
production and consumption patterns, 
human population dynamics and trends, 
trade, technological innovations and local 
through global governance. The rate of 
change in the direct and indirect drivers 
differs among regions and countries. 

 B1 For terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, 
land-use change has had the largest relative 
negative impact on nature since 1970, followed by 
the direct exploitation, in particular 
overexploitation, of animals, plants and other 
organisms, mainly via harvesting, logging, hunting 
and fishing. In marine ecosystems, direct 
exploitation of organisms (mainly fishing) has had 
the largest relative impact, followed by land-/
sea-use change. Agricultural expansion is the most 
widespread form of land-use change, with over one third of 
the terrestrial land surface being used for cropping or animal 
husbandry. This expansion, alongside a doubling of urban 
area since 1992 and an unprecedented expansion of 
infrastructure linked to growing population and 
consumption, has come mostly at the expense of forests 
(largely old-growth tropical forests), wetlands and 
grasslands. In freshwater ecosystems, a series of combined 
threats that include land-use change, including water 
extraction, exploitation, pollution, climate change and 
invasive species, are prevalent. Human activities have had a 
large and widespread impact on the world’s oceans. These 
include direct exploitation, in particular overexploitation, of 
fish, shellfish and other organisms, land- and sea-based 
pollution, including from river networks, and land-/sea-use 
change, including coastal development for infrastructure 
and aquaculture.

 B2 Climate change is a direct driver that is 
increasingly exacerbating the impact of other 
drivers on nature and human well-being. Humans are 
estimated to have caused an observed warming of 
approximately 1.0°C by 2017 relative to pre-industrial levels, 
with average temperatures over the past 30 years rising by 
0.2°C per decade. The frequency and intensity of extreme 
weather events, and the fires, floods and droughts that they 
can bring, have increased in the past 50 years, while the 
global average sea level has risen by between 16 and 21 cm 
since 1900, and at a rate of more than 3 mm per year over 
the past two decades. These changes have contributed to 
widespread impacts in many aspects of biodiversity, 
including species distribution, phenology, population 
dynamics, community structure and ecosystem function. 
According to observational evidence, the effects are 
accelerating in marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems 
and are already impacting agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries 
and nature’s contributions to people. The compounding 
effects of drivers such as climate change, land-/sea-use 
change, overexploitation of resources, pollution and invasive 
alien species are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts 
on nature, as seen in different ecosystems including coral 
reefs, the Arctic systems and savannas.

 B3 Many types of pollution, as well as invasive 
alien species, are increasing, with negative 
impacts for nature. Although global trends are mixed, air, 
water and soil pollution have continued to increase in some 
areas. Marine plastic pollution in particular has increased 
tenfold since 1980, affecting at least 267 species, including 

86 per cent of marine turtles, 44 per cent of seabirds and 
43 per cent of marine mammals. This can affect humans 
through food chains. Greenhouse gas emissions, untreated 
urban and rural waste, pollutants from industrial, mining and 
agricultural activities, oil spills and toxic dumping have had 
strong negative effects on soil, freshwater and marine water 
quality and on the global atmosphere. Cumulative records of 
alien species have increased by 40 per cent since 1980, 
associated with increased trade and human population 
dynamics and trends. Nearly one fifth of the Earth’s surface 
is at risk of plant and animal invasions, impacting native 
species, ecosystem functions and nature’s contributions to 
people, as well as economies and human health. The rate of 
introduction of new invasive alien species seems higher than 
ever before and shows no signs of slowing. 

 B4 In the past 50 years, the human population has 
doubled, the global economy has grown nearly 
fourfold and global trade has grown tenfold, 
together driving up the demand for energy and 
materials. A variety of economic, political and social factors, 
including global trade and the spatial decoupling of 
production from consumption, have shifted the economic 
and environmental gains and losses of production and 
consumption, contributing to new economic opportunities, 
but also to impacts on nature and its contributions to people. 
Levels of consumption of material goods (food, feed, timber 
and fibre) vary greatly, and unequal access to material goods 
can be associated with inequity and may lead to social 
conflict. Economic exchange contributes to aggregate 
economic development, yet often is negotiated between

actors and institutions of unequal power, which influences the 
distribution of benefits and long-term impacts. Countries at 
different levels of development have experienced different 
levels of deterioration of nature for any given gain in economic 
growth. Exclusion, scarcity and/or the unequal distribution of 
nature’s contributions to people may fuel social instability and 
conflict in a complex interaction with other factors. Armed 
conflicts have an impact on ecosystems beyond their 
destabilizing effects on societies, and a range of indirect 
impacts, including the displacement of people and activities.

 B5 Economic incentives have generally favoured 
expanding economic activity, and often 
environmental harm, over conservation or 
restoration. Incorporating the consideration of the 
multiple values of ecosystem functions and of 
nature’s contributions to people into economic 
incentives has, in the economy, been shown to 
permit better ecological, economic and social 
outcomes. Local, national, regional and global governance 
initiatives have improved outcomes in this way by supporting 
policies, innovation and the elimination of environmentally 
harmful subsidies, introducing incentives in line with the value 
of nature’s contribution to people, increasing sustainable 
land-/sea-use management and enforcing regulations, 
among other measures. Harmful economic incentives and 
policies associated with unsustainable practices in fisheries, 
aquaculture, agriculture (including fertilizer and pesticide use), 
livestock management, forestry, mining and energy (including 
fossil fuels and biofuels) are often associated with land-/
sea-use change and overexploitation of natural resources, as 
well as inefficient production and waste management. Vested 
interests may oppose the removal of subsidies or the 
introduction of other policies. Yet policy reforms to deal with 
such causes of environmental harm offer the potential to 
both conserve nature and provide economic benefits, 
including when policies are based on more and better 
understanding of the multiple values of nature’s contributions.

 B6 Nature managed by indigenous peoples and 
local communities is under increasing pressure. 
Nature is generally declining less rapidly in 
indigenous peoples’ land than in other lands, but is 
nevertheless declining, as is the knowledge of how 
to manage it. At least a quarter of the global land 
area is traditionally owned, managed3, used or 
occupied by indigenous peoples. These areas include 
approximately 35 per cent of the area that is formally 
protected, and approximately 35 per cent of all remaining 
terrestrial areas with very low human intervention. In 
addition, a diverse array of local communities, including 
farmers, fishers, herders, hunters, ranchers and forest users,

determining the use, development and care of land resources in a manner 
that fulfils material and non-material cultural needs, including livelihood 
activities such as hunting, fishing, gathering, resource harvesting, pastoralism 
and small-scale agriculture and horticulture.

manage significant areas under various property and access 
regimes. Among the local indicators developed and used by 
indigenous peoples and local communities, 72 per cent 
show negative trends in nature that underpin local 
livelihoods and well-being. The areas managed (under 
various types of tenure and access regimes) by indigenous 
peoples and local communities are facing growing resource 
extraction, commodity production, mining and transport and 
energy infrastructure, with various consequences for local 
livelihoods and health. Some climate change mitigation 
programmes have had negative impacts on indigenous 
peoples and local communities. The negative impacts of all 
these pressures include continued loss of subsistence and 
traditional livelihoods resulting from ongoing deforestation, 
loss of wetlands, mining, the spread of unsustainable 
agriculture, forestry and fishing practices and impacts on 
health and well-being from pollution and water insecurity. 
These impacts also challenge traditional management, the 
transmission of indigenous and local knowledge, the 
potential for sharing of benefits arising from the use of, and 
the ability of indigenous peoples and local communities to 
conserve and sustainably manage, wild and domesticated 
biodiversity that are also relevant to broader society.

C.	Goals for conserving and 
sustainably using nature and 
achieving sustainability cannot 
be met by current trajectories, 
and goals for 2030 and beyond 
may only be achieved through 
transformative changes4 across 
economic, social, political and 
technological factors.

Past and ongoing rapid declines in 
biodiversity, ecosystem functions and many 
of nature’s contributions to people mean that 
most international societal and environmental 
goals, such as those embodied in the Aichi 
Biodiversity Targets and the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development, will not be 
achieved based on current trajectories. 
These declines will also undermine other 
goals, such as those specified in the Paris 
Agreement adopted under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity.

The negative trends in biodiversity and 
ecosystem functions are projected to 
continue or worsen in many future scenarios 
in response to indirect drivers such as rapid 
human population growth, unsustainable 
production and consumption and associated 
technological development. In contrast, 
scenarios and pathways that explore the 
effects of low-to-moderate population 
growth, and transformative changes in the 
production and consumption of energy, 
food, feed, fibre and water, sustainable 
use, equitable sharing of the benefits 
arising from use and nature-friendly climate 
adaptation and mitigation will better support 
the achievement of future societal and 
environmental objectives.

 C1 The implementation of policy responses and 
actions to conserve nature and manage it more 
sustainably has progressed, yielding positive 
outcomes relative to scenarios of no intervention, 
but progress is not sufficient to stem the direct and 
indirect drivers of nature deterioration. It is 
therefore likely that most of the Aichi Biodiversity 
Targets for 2020 will be missed. Some of the Aichi 
Biodiversity Targets will be partially achieved, for example 
those related to policy responses, such as the spatial extent 
of terrestrial and marine protected areas, the identification 
and prioritization of invasive alien species, national 
biodiversity strategies and action plans, and the Nagoya 
Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and 
Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to 
the Convention on Biological Diversity. However, while 
protected areas now cover 15 per cent of terrestrial and 
freshwater environments and 7 per cent of the marine realm, 
they only partly cover important sites for biodiversity and are 
not yet fully ecologically representative and effectively or 
equitably managed. There has been significant growth in 
official development assistance in support of the Convention 
on Biological Diversity and in funding provided by the Global 
Environment Facility, with biodiversity aid flows reaching 
$8.7 billion annually. However, current resource mobilization 
from all sources is not sufficient to achieve the Aichi 
Biodiversity Targets. In addition, only one in five of the 
strategic objective and goals across six global agreements5 

5.	 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna 
and Flora, Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and

Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing 
Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, and Convention 
on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat.

relating to nature and the protection of the global 
environment are demonstrably on track to be met. For nearly 
one third of the goals of these conventions, there has been 
little or no progress towards them or, instead, movement 
away from them.

 C2 Nature is essential for achieving the 
Sustainable Development Goals. However, taking 
into consideration that the Sustainable 
Development Goals are integrated, indivisible, and 
nationally implemented, current negative trends in 
biodiversity and ecosystems will undermine 
progress towards 80 per cent (35 out of 44) of the 
assessed targets of Goals related to poverty, 
hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and 
land (Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 
13, 14, and 15). Important positive synergies between 
nature and the Goals related to education, gender equality, 
reducing inequalities and promoting peace and justice 
(Sustainable Development Goals 4, 5, 10 and 16) were 
found. Land or resource tenure insecurity, as well as 
declines in nature, have greater impacts on women and 
girls, who are most often negatively impacted. However, the 
current focus and wording of the targets of these Goals 
obscures or omits their relationship to nature, thereby 
preventing their assessment here. There is a critical need for 
future policy targets, indicators and datasets to more 
explicitly account for aspects of nature and their relevance 
to human well-being in order to more effectively track the 
consequences of trends in nature on the Sustainable 
Development Goals. Some pathways chosen to achieve the 
Goals related to energy, economic growth, industry and 
infrastructure, and sustainable consumption and production 
(Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, 9 and 12), as well as 
the targets related to poverty, food security and cities 
(Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2 and 11), could have 
substantial positive or negative impacts on nature and 
therefore on the achievement of the other Sustainable 
Development Goals.

 C3 Areas of the world projected to experience 
significant negative effects from global changes in 
climate, biodiversity, ecosystem functions and 
nature’s contributions to people are also home to 
large concentrations of indigenous peoples and 
many of the world’s poorest communities. Because 
of their strong dependency on nature and its contributions 
for subsistence, livelihoods and health, those communities 
will be disproportionately hard-hit by those negative 
changes. Those negative effects also influence the ability of 
indigenous peoples and local communities to manage and 
conserve wild and domesticated biodiversity and nature’s 
contributions to people. Indigenous peoples and local 
communities have been proactively confronting such 
challenges in partnership with each other and with an array 
of other stakeholders, through co-management systems

and local and regional monitoring networks and by 
revitalizing and adapting local management systems. 
Regional and global scenarios lack an explicit consideration 
of the views, perspectives and rights of indigenous peoples 
and local communities, their knowledge and understanding 
of large regions and ecosystems, and their desired future 
development pathways.

 C4 Except in scenarios that include transformative 
change, negative trends in nature, in ecosystem 
functions and in many of nature’s contributions to 
people are projected to continue to 2050 and 
beyond, due to the projected impacts of increasing 
land-/and sea-use change, exploitation of 
organisms and climate change. Negative impacts 
arising from pollution and invasive alien species will likely 
exacerbate these trends. There are large regional differences 
in the projected patterns of future biodiversity and 
ecosystem functions and in the losses and changes in 
nature’s contributions to people. These differences arise 
from the direct and indirect drivers of change, which are 
projected to impact regions in different ways. While regions 
worldwide face further declines in biodiversity in future 
projections, tropical regions face particular combined risks 
of declines due to the interactions between climate change, 
land-use change and fisheries exploitation. Marine and 
terrestrial biodiversity in boreal, subpolar and polar regions is 
projected to decline mostly because of warming, sea ice 
retreat and enhanced ocean acidification. The magnitude of 
the impacts and the differences between regions are much 
greater in scenarios with rapid increases in consumption or 
human population than in scenarios based on sustainability. 
Acting immediately and simultaneously on the multiple 
indirect and direct drivers has the potential to slow, halt and 
even reverse some aspects of biodiversity and 
ecosystem loss.

 C5 Climate change is projected to become 
increasingly important as a direct driver of 
changes in nature and its contributions to people 
in the next decades. Scenarios show that meeting 
the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2050 
Vision for Biodiversity depends on taking into 
account climate change impacts in the definition 
of future goals and objectives. The future impacts of 
climate change are projected to become more pronounced 
in the next decades, with variable relative effects 
depending on scenario and geographic region. Scenarios 
project mostly adverse climate change effects on 
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, which worsen, in 
some cases exponentially, with incremental global 
warming. Even for global warming of 1.5°C to 2°C, the 
majority of terrestrial species ranges are projected to shrink 
dramatically. Changes in ranges can adversely affect the 
capacity of terrestrial protected areas to conserve species, 
greatly increase local species turnover and substantially 

increase the risk of global extinctions. For example, a 
synthesis of many studies estimates that the fraction of 
species at risk of climate-related extinction is 5 per cent at 
2°C warming and rises to 16 per cent at 4.3°C warming. 
Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to climate change 
and are projected to decline to 10 to 30 per cent of former 
cover at 1.5°C warming and to less than 1 per cent of 
former cover at 2°C warming. Therefore, scenarios show 
that limiting global warming to well below 2°C plays a 
critical role in reducing adverse impacts on nature and its 
contributions to people.

D.	Nature can be conserved, 
restored and used sustainably 
while other global societal goals 
are simultaneously met through 
urgent and concerted efforts 
fostering transformative change.

Societal goals, including those related 
to food, water, energy, health and the 
achievement of human well-being for all, 
mitigating and adapting to climate change 
and conserving and sustainably using 
nature, can be achieved in sustainable 
pathways through the rapid and improved 
deployment of existing policy instruments 
and new initiatives that more effectively 
enlist individual and collective action for 
transformative change. Since current 
structures often inhibit sustainable 
development and actually represent the 
indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, such 
fundamental, structural change is called 
for. By its very nature, transformative 
change can expect opposition from those 
with interests vested in the status quo, 
but such opposition can be overcome 
for the broader public good. If obstacles 
are overcome, a commitment to mutually 
supportive international goals and targets, 
supporting actions by indigenous peoples 
and local communities at the local level, new 
frameworks for private sector investment 
and innovation, inclusive and adaptive 
governance approaches and arrangements, 
multi-sectoral planning, and strategic policy 
mixes can help to transform the public and

ecological restoration and sustainable use by all 
actors, including individuals, are key to this 
safeguarding. Such widespread adoption implies 
advancing and aligning local, national and international 
sustainability efforts and mainstreaming biodiversity and 
sustainability across all extractive and productive sectors, 
including mining, fisheries, forestry and agriculture, so that 
together, individual and collective actions result in a reversal 
of the deterioration of ecosystem services at the global level. 
Yet these bold changes to the direct drivers of the 
deterioration of nature cannot be achieved without 
transformative change that simultaneously addresses the 
indirect drivers.

 D2 Five main interventions (“levers”) can 
generate transformative change by tackling the 
underlying indirect drivers of the deterioration of 
nature: (1) incentives and capacity-building; 
(2) cross-sectoral cooperation; (3) pre-emptive 
action; (4) decision-making in the context of 
resilience and uncertainty; and (5) environmental 
law and implementation. Using these levers will involve 
the following: (1) developing incentives and widespread 
capacity for environmental responsibility and eliminating 
perverse incentives; (2) reforming sectoral and segmented 
decision-making to promote integration across sectors and 
jurisdictions; (3) taking pre-emptive and precautionary 
actions in regulatory and management institutions and 
businesses to avoid, mitigate and remedy the deterioration 
of nature, and monitoring their outcomes; (4) managing for 
resilient social and ecological systems in the face of 
uncertainty and complexity, to deliver decisions that are 
robust in a wide range of scenarios; and (5) strengthening 
environmental laws and policies and their implementation, 
and the rule of law more generally. All five levers may require 
new resources, particularly in low-capacity contexts, such 
as in many developing countries.

 D3 Transformations towards sustainability are 
more likely when efforts are directed at the 
following key leverage points, where efforts yield 
exceptionally large effects (Figure SPM.9): 
(1) visions of a good life; (2) total consumption and 
waste; (3) values and action; (4) inequalities; 

(5) justice and inclusion in conservation; 
(6) externalities and telecouplings; (7) technology, 
innovation and investment; and (8) education and 
knowledge generation and sharing. Specifically, the 
following changes are mutually reinforcing: (1) enabling 
visions of a good quality of life that do not entail ever-
increasing material consumption; (2) lowering total 
consumption and waste, including by addressing both 
population growth and per capita consumption differently in 
different contexts; (3) unleashing existing, widely-held values 
of responsibility to effect new social norms for sustainability, 
especially by extending notions of responsibility to include 
the impacts associated with consumption; (4) addressing 
inequalities, especially regarding income and gender, which 
undermine the capacity for sustainability; (5) ensuring 
inclusive decision-making and the fair and equitable sharing 
of benefits arising from the use of and adherence to human 
rights in conservation decisions; (6) accounting for nature 
deterioration from local economic activities and 
socioeconomic and environmental interactions over 
distances (telecouplings), including, for example, 
international trade; (7) ensuring environmentally friendly 
technological and social innovation, taking into account 
potential rebound effects and investment regimes; and 
(8) promoting education, knowledge generation and the 
maintenance of different knowledge systems, including in 
the sciences and indigenous and local knowledge, regarding 
nature, conservation and its sustainable use.

 D4 The character and trajectories of 
transformation will vary across contexts, with 
challenges and needs differing, among others, in 
developing and developed countries. Risks related 
to the inevitable uncertainties and complexities in 
transformations towards sustainability can be 
reduced through governance approaches that are 
integrative, inclusive, informed and adaptive. Such 
approaches typically take into account the synergies and 
trade-offs between societal goals and alternative pathways 
and recognize a plurality of values, diverse economic 
conditions, inequity, power imbalances and vested interests 
in society. Risk-reducing strategies typically include learning 
from experience that is based on a combination of 
precautionary measures and existing and emerging 
knowledge. These approaches involve stakeholders in the 
coordination of policies across sectors and in the creation of 
strategic, locally relevant mixes of successful policy 
instruments. The private sector can play a role in partnership 
with other actors, including national and subnational 
governments and civil society; for example, public-private 
partnerships in the water sector have been an important 
vehicle for financing investments to meet the Sustainable 
Development Goals. Some effective policy measures include 
the expansion and strengthening of ecologically 
representative, well-connected protected-area networks and 
of other effective area-based conservation measures; the

protection of watersheds; and incentives and sanctions to 
reduce pollution (Table SPM.1).

 D5 Recognizing the knowledge, innovations, 
practices, institutions and values of indigenous 
peoples and local communities, and ensuring their 
inclusion and participation in environmental 
governance, often enhances their quality of life and 
the conservation, restoration and sustainable use 
of nature, which is relevant to broader society. 
Governance, including customary institutions and 
management systems and co-management regimes 
that involve indigenous peoples and local 
communities, can be an effective way to safeguard 
nature and its contributions to people by 
incorporating locally attuned management systems 
and indigenous and local knowledge. The positive 
contributions of indigenous peoples and local communities 
to sustainability can be facilitated through national 
recognition of land tenure, access and resource rights in 
accordance with national legislation, the application of free, 
prior and informed consent, and improved collaboration, fair 
and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use, and 
co-management arrangements with local communities.

 D6 Feeding humanity and enhancing the 
conservation and sustainable use of nature are 
complementary and closely interdependent goals 
that can be advanced through sustainable 
agriculture, aquaculture and livestock systems, the 
safeguarding of native species, varieties, breeds 
and habitats, and ecological restoration. Specific 
actions include promoting sustainable agricultural and 
agroecological practices, such as multifunctional landscape 
planning and cross-sectoral integrated management, that 
support the conservation of genetic diversity and the 
associated agricultural biodiversity. Further actions to 
simultaneously achieve food security, biodiversity protection 
and sustainable use are context appropriate climate change 
mitigation and adaptation; incorporating knowledge from 
various systems, including the sciences and sustainable 
indigenous and local practices; avoiding food waste; 
empowering producers and consumers to transform supply 
chains; and facilitating sustainable and healthy dietary 
choices. As part of integrated landscape planning and 
management, prompt ecological restoration, emphasizing 
the use of native species, can offset the current degradation 
and save many endangered species, but is less effective 
if delayed.

 D7 Sustaining and conserving fisheries and 
marine species and ecosystems can be achieved 
through a coordinated mix of interventions on land, 
in freshwater and in the oceans, including 
multilevel coordination across stakeholders on the 
use of open oceans. Specific actions could include, for 

example, ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries 
management, spatial planning, effective quotas, marine 
protected areas, protecting and managing key marine 
biodiversity areas, reducing run-off pollution into oceans and 
working closely with producers and consumers (Table 
SPM.1). It is important to enhance capacity-building for the 
adoption of best fisheries management practices; adopt 
measures to promote conservation financing and corporate 
social responsibility; develop new legal and binding 
instruments; implement and enforce global agreements for 
responsible fisheries; and urgently take all steps necessary 
to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and 
unregulated fishing.

 D8 Land-based climate change mitigation 
activities can be effective and support 
conservation goals (Table SPM.1). However, the 
large-scale deployment of bioenergy plantations 
and afforestation of non-forest ecosystems can 
come with negative side effects for biodiversity 
and ecosystem functions. Nature-based solutions with 
safeguards are estimated to provide 37 per cent of climate 
change mitigation until 2030 needed to meet the goal of 
keeping climate warming below 2°C, with likely co-benefits 
for biodiversity. Therefore, land-use actions are 
indispensable, in addition to strong actions to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use and other 
industrial and agricultural activities. However, the large-
scale deployment of intensive bioenergy plantations, 
including monocultures, replacing natural forests and 
subsistence farmlands, will likely have negative impacts on 
biodiversity and can threaten food and water security as 
well as local livelihoods, including by intensifying 
social conflict.

 D9 Nature-based solutions can be cost-effective 
for meeting the Sustainable Development Goals in 
cities, which are crucial for global sustainability. 
Increased use of green infrastructure and other ecosystem-
based approaches can help to advance sustainable urban 
development while reinforcing climate mitigation and 
adaptation. Urban key biodiversity areas should be 
safeguarded. Solutions can include retrofitting green and 
blue infrastructure, such as creating and maintaining green 
spaces and biodiversity-friendly water bodies, urban 
agriculture, rooftop gardens and expanded and accessible 
vegetation cover in existing urban and peri-urban areas and 
new developments. Green infrastructure in urban and 
surrounding rural areas can complement large-scale “grey 
infrastructure” in areas such as flood protection, temperature 
regulation, cleaning of air and water, treating wastewater 
and the provision of energy, locally sourced food and the 
health benefits of interaction with nature.

systems to build a global sustainable economy, 
steering away from the current, limited paradigm of 
economic growth. That implies incorporating the 
reduction of inequalities into development pathways, 
reducing overconsumption and waste and addressing 
environmental impacts, such as externalities of economic 
activities, from the local to the global scales. Such an 
evolution could be enabled through a mix of policies and 
tools (such as incentive programmes, certification and 
performance standards) and through more internationally 
consistent taxation, supported by multilateral agreements 
and enhanced environmental monitoring and evaluation. It 
would also entail a shift beyond standard economic 
indicators such as gross domestic product to include those 
able to capture more holistic, long-term views of economics 
and quality of life.

BACKGROUND
A. Nature and its vital contributions to people, which 
together embody biodiversity and ecosystem functions and 
services, are deteriorating worldwide.

 1 Nature underpins quality of life by providing 
basic life support for humanity (regulating), as well 
as material goods (material) and spiritual inspiration 
(non-material) (well established) {2.3.1, 2.3.2}. Most 
of nature’s contributions to people (NCP) are 
co-produced by biophysical processes and 
ecological interactions with anthropogenic assets 
such as knowledge, infrastructure, financial capital, 
technology and the institutions that mediate them 
(well established) {2.3.2} (Appendix I). For example, 
marine and freshwater-based food is co-produced by the 
combination of fish populations, fishing gear, and access to 
fishing grounds {2.3.3} There is unequal access to nature’s 
contributions and unequal impact of nature’s contributions 
on different social groups (established but incomplete) 
{2.3.5}. Furthermore, increases in the production of some of 
nature’s contributions cause declines in others (Figure 
SPM.1) {2.3.2, 2.3.5}, which also affects people differently 
(well established). For example, clearing of forest for 
agriculture has increased the supply of food, feed, (NCP 12) 
and other materials important for people (such as natural 
fibres and ornamental flowers: NCP 13), but has reduced 
contributions as diverse as pollination (NCP 2), climate 
regulation (NCP 4), water quality regulation (NCP 7), 
opportunities for learning and inspiration (NCP 15) and the 
maintenance of options for the future (NCP 18). However, 
very few large-scale systematic studies exist on those 
relationships {2.3.2}. Land degradation has reduced 
productivity in 23 per cent of the global terrestrial area, and 
between $235 billion and $577 billion in annual global crop 
output is at risk as a result of pollinator loss {2.3.5.3} 
(established but incomplete).

 2 Many of nature’s contributions to people are 
essential for human health (well established) and their 
decline thus threatens a good quality of life 
(established but incomplete) {2.3.4}. Nature provides a 
broad diversity of nutritious foods, medicines and clean 
water (well established) {2.3.5.2, 3.3.2.1, 3.3.2.2 
(Sustainable Development Goal 3)}; can help to regulate 
disease and the immune system {2.3.4.2}; can reduce levels 
of certain air pollutants (established but incomplete) {2.3.4.2, 
3.3.2.2}; and can improve mental and physical health 
through exposure to natural areas (inconclusive), among 
other contributions {2.3.2.2, 2.3.4.2, 3.3.2.2 (Sustainable 

Development Goal 3)}. Nature is the origin of most infectious 
diseases (negative impact), but also the source of medicines 
and antibiotics for treatment (positive contribution) (well 
established). Zoonotic diseases are significant threats to 
human health, with vector-borne diseases accounting for 
approximately 17 per cent of all infectious diseases and 
causing an estimated 700,000 deaths globally per annum 
(established but incomplete) {3.3.2.2}. Emerging infectious 
diseases in wildlife, domestic animals, plants or people can be 
exacerbated by human activities such as land clearing and 
habitat fragmentation (established but incomplete) or the 
overuse of antibiotics driving rapid evolution of antibiotic 
resistance in many bacterial pathogens (well established) 
{3.3.2.2}. The deterioration of nature and consequent 
disruption of benefits to people has both direct and indirect 
implications for public health (well established) {2.3.5.2} and 
can exacerbate existing inequalities in access to health care or 
healthy diets (established but incomplete) {2.3.4.2}. Shifting 
diets towards a diversity of foods, including fish, fruit, nuts 
and vegetables, significantly reduces the risk of certain 
preventable non-communicable diseases, which are 
currently responsible for 20 per cent of premature mortality 
globally (well established) {2.3.4.2, 2.3.5.2 (NCP 2 and 12)}.

 3 Most of nature’s contributions are not fully 
replaceable, yet some contributions of nature are 
irreplaceable (well established). Loss of diversity, such 
as phylogenetic and functional diversity, can permanently 
reduce future options, such as wild species that might be 
domesticated as new crops and be used for genetic 
improvement {2.3.5.3}. People have created substitutes for 
some other contributions of nature, but many of them are 
imperfect or financially prohibitive {2.3.2.2}. For example, 
high-quality drinking water can be realized either through 
ecosystems that filter pollutants or through human-
engineered water treatment facilities {2.3.5.3}. Similarly, 
coastal flooding from storm surges can be reduced either by 
coastal mangroves or by dikes and sea walls {2.3.5.3}. In 
both cases, however, built infrastructure can be extremely 
expensive, incur high future costs and fail to provide 
synergistic benefits such as nursery habitats for edible fish 
or recreational opportunities {2.3.5.2}. More generally, 
human-made replacements often do not provide the full 
range of benefits provided by nature {2.3.2.2} 
(Figure SPM.1).

 4 Humanity is a dominant global influence on life 
on earth, and has caused natural terrestrial, 
freshwater and marine ecosystems to decline (well 
established) {2.2.5.2} (Figure SPM.2). Global indicators of 
ecosystem extent and condition have shown a decrease by 
an average of 47 per cent of their estimated natural 
baselines, with many continuing to decline by at least 4 per 
cent per decade (established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.1}. 
On land, particularly sensitive ecosystems include old-
growth forests, insular ecosystems, and wetlands; and only 
around 25 per cent of land is sufficiently unimpacted that 
ecological and evolutionary processes still operate with 
minimal human intervention (established but incomplete) 
{2.2.3.4.1, 2.2.5.2.1}. In terrestrial “hotspots” of endemic 
species, natural habitats have generally undergone greater 
reductions to date in extent and condition, and tend to be 
experiencing more rapid ongoing decline, on average than 
other terrestrial regions {2.2.5.2.1}. Globally, the net rate of 
forest loss has halved since the 1990s, largely because of 
net increases in temperate and high latitude forests; 
high-biodiversity tropical forests continue to dwindle, and 
global forest area is now approximately 68 per cent of the 
estimated pre-industrial level (established but incomplete) 
{2.2.5.2.1}. Forests and natural mosaics sufficiently 
undamaged to be classed as “intact” (defined as being 
larger than 500 km2 where satellites can detect no human 
pressure) were reduced by 7 per cent (919, 000 km2) 
between 2000 and 2013, shrinking in both developed and 
developing countries {2.2.5.2.1}. Inland waters and 
freshwater ecosystems show among the highest rates of 
decline. Only 13 per cent of the wetland present in 1700 
remained by 2000; recent losses have been even more 
rapid (0.8 per cent per year from 1970 to 2008) (established 
but incomplete) {2.2.7.9}. 

 5 Marine ecosystems, from coastal to deep sea, 
now show the influence of human actions, with 
coastal marine ecosystems showing both large 
historical losses of extent and condition as well as 
rapid ongoing declines (established but incomplete) 
{2.2.5.2.1, 2.2.7.15} (Figure SPM.2). Over 40 per cent of 
ocean area was strongly affected by multiple drivers in 2008, 
and 66 per cent was experiencing increasing cumulative 
impacts in 2014. Only 3 per cent of the ocean was 
described as free from human pressure in 2014 (established 
but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.1, 3.2.1}. Seagrass meadows 
decreased in extent by over 10 per cent per decade from 
1970 to 2000 (established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.1}. Live 
coral cover on reefs has nearly halved in the past 150 years, 
the decline dramatically accelerating over the past two or 
three decades due to increased water temperature and 
ocean acidification interacting with and further exacerbating 
other drivers of loss (well established) {2.2.5.2.1}. These 
coastal marine ecosystems are among the most productive 
systems globally, and their loss and deterioration reduce 
their ability to protect shorelines, and the people and 

species that live there, from storms, as well as their ability to 
provide sustainable livelihoods (well established) {2.2.5.2.1, 
2.3.5.2}. Severe impacts to ocean ecosystems are 
illustrated by 33 per cent of fish stocks being classified as 
overexploited and greater than 55 per cent of ocean area 
being subject to industrial fishing (established but 
incomplete) {2.1.11.1, 2.2.5.2.4, 2.2.7.16}.

 6 The global rate of species extinction is already at 
least tens to hundreds of times higher than the 
average rate over the past 10 million years and is 
accelerating (established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.4} 
(Figure SPM.3). Human actions have already driven at least 
680 vertebrate species to extinction since 1500, including 
the Pinta Giant Tortoise in the Galapagos in 2012, even 
though successful conservation efforts have saved from 
extinction at least 26 bird species and 6 ungulate species, 
including the Arabian Oryx and Przewalski’s Horse {3.2.1}. 
The threat of extinction is also accelerating: in the best-
studied taxonomic groups, most of the total extinction risk 
to species is estimated to have arisen in the past 40 years 
(established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.4}. The proportion of 
species currently threatened with extinction according to the 
International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List 
criteria averages around 25 per cent across the many 
terrestrial, freshwater and marine vertebrate, invertebrate 
and plant groups that have been studied in sufficient detail 
to support a robust overall estimate (established but 
incomplete) {2.2.5.2.4, 3.2}. More than 40 per cent of 
amphibian species, almost a third of reef-forming corals, 
sharks and shark relatives and over a third of marine 
mammals are currently threatened {2.2.5.2.4, 3}. The 
proportion of insect species threatened with extinction is a 
key uncertainty, but available evidence supports a tentative 
estimate of 10 per cent (established but incomplete) 
{2.2.5.2.4}. Those proportions suggest that, of an estimated 
8 million animal and plant species (75 per cent of which are 
insects), around 1 million are threatened with extinction 
(established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.4}. A similar picture 
also emerges from an entirely separate line of evidence. 
Habitat loss and deterioration, largely caused by human 
actions, have reduced global terrestrial habitat integrity by 
30 per cent relative to an unimpacted baseline; combining 
that with the longstanding relationship between habitat area 
and species numbers suggests that around 9 per cent of 
the world’s estimated 5.9 million terrestrial species – more 
than 500,000 species – have insufficient habitat for 
long-term survival, and are committed to extinction, many 
within decades, unless their habitats are restored 
(established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.4}. Population declines 
often give warning that a species’ risk of extinction is 
increasing. The Living Planet Index, which synthesises 
trends in vertebrate populations, shows that species have 
declined rapidly since 1970, with reductions of 40 per cent 
for terrestrial species, 84 per cent for freshwater species 
and 35 per cent for marine species (established but

Figure SPM 2  �Examples of global declines in nature, emphasizing declines in biodiversity, that 
have been and are being caused by direct and indirect drivers of change. 

The direct drivers (land-/sea-use change; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species)6 result 
from an array of underlying societal causes7. These causes can be demographic (e.g., human population dynamics), sociocultural 
(e.g., consumption patterns), economic (e.g., trade), technological, or relating to institutions, governance, conflicts and epidemics. 
They are called indirect drivers8 and are underpinned by societal values and behaviours. The colour bands represent the relative 
global impact of direct drivers, from top to bottom, on terrestrial, freshwater and marine nature, as estimated from a global systematic 
review of studies published since 2005. Land- and sea-use change and direct exploitation account for more than 50 per cent of the 
global impact on land, in fresh water and in the sea, but each driver is dominant in certain contexts {2.2.6}. The circles illustrate the 
magnitude of the negative human impacts on a diverse selection of aspects of nature over a range of different time scales based on a 
global synthesis of indicators {2.2.5, 2.2.7}.

such as wild bees and butterflies have often been reported, 
and insect abundance has declined very rapidly in some 
places even without large-scale land-use change, but the 
global extent of such declines is not known (established but

high degree of adaptation (genotypic and phenotypic) to 
local conditions (well established) {2.2.4.4}. As a result, the 
pool of genetic variation which underpins food security has 
declined (well established) {2.2.5.2.6}. Ten per cent of 
domesticated breeds of mammals were recorded as 
extinct, as well as some 3.5 per cent of domesticated 
breeds of birds (well established) {2.2.5.2.6}. Many 
hotspots of agrobiodiversity and crop wild relatives are also 
under threat or not formally protected. The conservation 
status of wild relatives of domesticated livestock has also 
deteriorated. These wild relatives represent critical 
reservoirs of genes and traits that may provide resilience 
against future climate change, pests and pathogens and 
may improve current heavily depleted gene pools of many 
crops and domestic animals {2.2.3.4.3}. The lands of

where human influence is greater (established but 
incomplete) {2.2.5.2.6}. 

 8 Human-driven changes in species diversity 
within local ecological communities vary widely, 
depending on the net balance between species 
loss and the influx of alien species, disturbance-
tolerant species, other human-adapted species or 
climate migrant species (well established) {2.2.5.2.3}. 
Even though human-dominated landscapes are sometimes 
species-rich, their species composition is markedly altered 
from that in natural landscapes (well established) {2.2.5.2.3, 
2.2.7.10, 2.2.7.11}. As a result of human-caused changes 
in community composition, naturally occurring species in 
local terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are estimated to 
have lost at least 20 per cent of their original abundance on 
average, with hotspots of endemic species tending to have 
lost even more (established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.3}. The 
traits of species influence whether they persist or even 
thrive in human-modified ecosystems (well established) 
{2.2.3.6, 2.2.5.2.5}. For example, species that are large, 
grow slowly, are habitat specialists or are carnivores – such 
as great apes, tropical hardwood trees, sharks and big cats 
– are disappearing from many areas. Many other species, 
including those with opposite characteristics, are becoming 
more abundant locally and are spreading quickly around the 
world; across a set of 21 countries with detailed records, 
the numbers of invasive alien species per country have 
risen by some 70 per cent since 1970 {2.2.5.2.3}. The 
effects of invasive alien species are often particularly severe 
for the native species and assemblages on islands and in 
other settings with high proportions of endemic species 
(well established) {2.2.3.4.1, 2.2.5.2.3}. Invasive alien 
species can have devastating effects on mainland 
assemblages as well: for example, a single invasive 
pathogen species, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is a 
threat to nearly 400 amphibian species worldwide and has 
already caused a number of extinctions (well established) 
{2.2.5.2.3}. Many drivers add already widespread species 
to ecological communities in many places; and many 
drivers cause endemic species to decline in many places. 
These two processes have contributed to the widespread 
erosion of differences between ecological communities in 
different places, a phenomenon known as biotic 
homogenization or the “anthropogenic blender” (well 
established) {2.2.5.2.3}. The consequences of all these 
changes for ecosystem processes and hence nature’s 
contributions to people can be very significant. For 
example, the decline and disappearance of large herbivores 
and predators has dramatically affected the structure, fire 
regimes, seed dispersal, land surface albedo and nutrient 
availability within many ecosystems (well established) 
{2.2.5.2.1}. However, the consequences of changes often 
depend on details of the ecosystem, remain hard to predict 
and are still understudied (established but incomplete)  
{2.2.5.2.3}.

 9 Many organisms show ongoing biological 
evolution so rapid that it is detectable within only a 
few years or even more quickly – in response to 
anthropogenic drivers (well established) {2.2.5.2.5, 
2.2.5.2.6}. Management decisions that take those 
evolutionary changes into account will be noticeably 
more effective (established but incomplete) {Box 2.5}. 
This human-driven contemporary evolution, which has long 
been recognized in microbes, viruses, agricultural insect 
pests and weeds (well established), is now being observed 
in some species within all major taxonomic groups 
(animals, plants, fungi and microorganisms). Such changes 
are known to occur in response to human activities or 
drivers, such as hunting, fishing, harvesting, climate 
change, ocean acidification, soil and water pollution, 
invasive species, pathogens, pesticides and urbanization 
(established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.5}. However, 
management strategies typically assume that evolutionary 
changes occur only over much longer time periods and 
thus ignore rapid evolution. These policy considerations 
span many spheres in which management actions 
designed to slow or speed evolution can dramatically 
change outcomes, as the following examples indicate. 
Insects, weeds and pathogens evolve resistance to 
insecticides, herbicides and other control agents, yet 
management strategies such as refuges, crop rotation, and 
crop diversity can dramatically slow that undesirable 
evolution (well established) {Box 2.5}. Commercial fish 
populations have evolved to mature earlier under intensive 
harvesting, which sometimes can be minimized by 
mandating changes in fishing gear or fish size limits 
(established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.5}. Climate change 
favours the evolution of seasonally earlier reproduction in 
many organisms, which can in principle be facilitated 
through the introduction of individuals from populations 
already adapted to such conditions (established but 
incomplete) {2.2.5.2.5}. Mosquitoes rapidly evolve 
resistance to efforts to control them, but evolutionarily 
informed management actions can dramatically slow that 
undesirable evolution (established but incomplete) 
{2.2.5.2.5}. Contemporary evolution is thus relevant to 
many policy concerns. Understanding and working with 
contemporary evolution can address important concerns 
surrounding pollination and dispersal, coral persistence in 
the face of ocean acidification, water quality, pest 
regulation, food production and options for the future 
(established but incomplete). The specific actions taken will 
typically be case-specific and therefore will require careful 
assessment of evolutionary potential and consequences. In 
many cases, the best strategy could be to simply maintain 
the ability of natural populations to respond evolutionarily 
on their own – rather than through direct human 
manipulation of evolution.

B. Direct and indirect drivers of change have accelerated 
during the past 50 years.

 10 Today, humans extract more from the Earth and 
produce more waste than ever before (well 
established). Globally, land-use change is the direct 
driver with the largest relative impact on terrestrial 
and freshwater ecosystems, while direct exploitation 
of fish and seafood has the largest relative impact in 
the oceans (well established) (Figure SPM.2) {2.2.6.2}. 
Climate change, pollution and invasive alien species 
have had a lower relative impact to date but are 
accelerating (established but incomplete) {2.2.6.2, 3.2, 
4.2}. Although the pace of agricultural expansion into intact 
ecosystems {2.1.13} has varied from country to country, 
losses of intact ecosystems have occurred primarily in the 
tropics, home to the highest levels of biodiversity on the 
planet (for example, 100 million hectares of tropical forest 
from 1980 to 2000), due to cattle ranching in Latin America 
(~42 million ha) and plantations in South-East Asia 
(~7.5 million hectares, 80 per cent in oil palm) among others 
{2.1.13}, noting that plantations can also increase total 
forest area. Within land-use change, urban areas have more 
than doubled since 1992. In terms of direct exploitation, 
approximately 60 billion tons9 of renewable and non-
renewable resources {2.1.2} are being extracted each year. 
That total has nearly doubled since 1980, as population has 
grown considerably while the average per capita 
consumption of materials (e.g., plants, animals, fossil fuels, 
ores, construction material) has risen by 15 per cent since 
1980 (established but incomplete) {2.1.6, 2.1.11, 2.1.14}. 
This activity has generated unprecedented impacts: since 
1980, greenhouse gas emissions have doubled {2.1.11, 
2.1.12}, raising average global temperatures by at least 
0.7 °C {2.1.12}, while plastic pollution in oceans has 
increased tenfold {2.1.15}. Over 80 per cent of global 
wastewater is being discharged back into the environment 
without treatment, while 300–400 million tons of heavy 
metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes from 
industrial facilities are dumped into the world’s waters each 
year {2.1.15}. Excessive or inappropriate application of 
fertilizer can lead to run-off from fields and enter freshwater 
and coastal ecosystems, producing more than 400 hypoxic 
zones that affected a total area of more than 245,000 km2 
as early as 2008 {2.1.15}. In some island countries, invasive 
alien species have a significant impact on biodiversity, with 
introduced species being a key driver of extinctions.

 11 Land-use change is driven primarily by 
agriculture, forestry and urbanization, all of which are 
associated with air, water and soil pollution. Over one 
third of the world’s land surface and nearly three-quarters of 

9.	 All references to “tons” are to metric tons.

available freshwater resources are devoted to crop or 
livestock production {2.1.11}. Crop production occurs on 
some 12 per cent of total ice-free land. Grazing occurs on 
about 25 per cent of total ice-free lands and approximately 
70 per cent of drylands {2.1.11}. Approximately 25 per cent 
of the globe’s greenhouse gas emissions come from land 
clearing, crop production and fertilization, with animal-based 
food contributing 75 per cent of that. Intensive agriculture 
has increased food production at the cost of regulating and 
non-material contributions from nature, though 
environmentally beneficial practices are increasing. Small 
landholdings (less than 2 hectares) contribute approximately 
30 per cent of global crop production and 30 per cent of the 
global food caloric supply, using around a quarter of 
agricultural land and usually maintaining rich agrobiodiversity 
{2.1.11}. Moving to logging, between 1990 and 2015, 
clearing and wood harvest contributed to a total reduction 
of 290 million hectares in native forest cover, while the area 
of planted forests grew by 110 million hectares {2.1.11}. 
Industrial roundwood harvest is falling within some 
developed countries but rising on average in developing 
countries {2.1.11}. Illegal timber harvests and related trade 
supply 10–15 per cent of global timber, and up to 50 per 
cent in certain areas, hurting revenues for state owners and 
livelihoods for the rural poor. All mining on land has 
increased dramatically and, while still using less than 1 per 
cent of the Earth’s land, has had significant negative impacts 
on biodiversity, emissions of highly toxic pollutants, water 
quality and water distribution, and human health {2.1.11}. 
Mined products contribute more than 60 per cent of the 
GDP of 81 countries. There are approximately 17,000 large-
scale mining sites in 171 countries, with the legal sites 
mostly managed by international corporations, but there is 
also extensive illegal and small-scale mining that is harder to 
trace, and both types of sites are often in locations relevant 
for biodiversity {2.1.11}.

 12 In marine systems, fishing has had the most 
impact on biodiversity (target species, non-target 
species and habitats) in the past 50 years alongside 
other significant drivers (well established) {2.1.11, 
2.2.6.2} (Figure SPM.2). Global fish catches have been 
sustained by expanding fishing geographically and 
penetrating into deeper waters (well established) {3.2.1}. An 
increasing proportion of marine fish stocks are overfished 
(33 per cent in 2015), including stocks of economically 
important species, while 60 per cent are maximally 
sustainably fished and only 7 per cent are underfished (well 
established) {Box 3.1}. Industrial fishing, concentrated in a 
few countries and corporations {2.1.11}, covers at least 
55 per cent of the oceans, largely concentrated in the

northeast Atlantic, the northwest Pacific and upwelling 
regions off South America and West Africa (established but 
incomplete) {2.1.11}. Small-scale fisheries account for more 
than 90 per cent of commercial fishers (over 30 million 
people), and nearly half of global fish catch (established but 
incomplete). In 2011, illegal, unreported or unregulated 
fishing represented up to one third of the world’s reported 
catch (established but incomplete) {2.1.11}. Since 1992, 
regional fisheries bodies have been adopting sustainable 
development principles. For instance, more than 
170 members of the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations (FAO) adopted the Code of Conduct for 
Responsible Fisheries in 1995, and as of 1 April 2018, 
52 countries and one member organization had become 
Parties to the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, 
Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated 
Fishing, in order to address the depletion of marine fisheries 
(established but incomplete) {2.1.11}, reduce by-catch {3, 
box 3.3} and lower damage to seabeds and reefs. In 
addition, the set of established marine protected areas has 
been growing (well established) {2.1.11.1, 2.2.7.16}.

 13 The direct driver with the second highest relative 
impact on the oceans is the many changes in the uses 
of the sea and coastal land (well established) (Figure 
SPM.2) {2.2.6.2}. Coastal habitats, including estuaries and 
deltas critical for marine biota and regional economies, have 
been severely affected by sea-use changes (coastal 
development, offshore aquaculture, mariculture and bottom 
trawling) and land-use changes (onshore land clearance and 
urban sprawl along coastlines, plus pollution of rivers). 
Pollution from land sources is already a major driver of 
negative environmental change. Ocean mining, while 
relatively small, has expanded since 1981 to ~ 6,500 offshore 
oil and gas installations worldwide in 53 countries (60 per 
cent in the Gulf of Mexico by 2003) and likely will expand into 
the Arctic and Antarctic regions as the ice melts {2.1.11}. 
Ocean acidification from increased carbon dioxide levels 
largely affects shallow waters, with the ecosystems of the 
subarctic Pacific and western Arctic Ocean particularly 
affected. Plastic microparticles and nanoparticles are 
entering food webs in poorly understood ways {2.1.15.3}. 
Coastal waters hold the highest levels of metals and 
persistent organic pollutants from industrial discharge and 
agricultural run-off, poisoning coastal fish harvests. Severe 
effects from excess nutrient concentrations in certain 
locations include damage to fish and seabed biota. The 
dynamics of ocean and airborne transport of pollutants mean 
that the harm from inputs of plastics, persistent organic 
pollutants, heavy metals and ocean acidification is felt 
worldwide, including with consequences for human health.

 14 Climate change is already having an impact on 
nature, from genes to ecosystems. It poses a growing 
risk owing to the accelerated pace of change and 
interactions with other direct drivers (well established) 

{2.1.12, 2.1.18, 2.2.6.2}. Shifts in species distribution, 
changes in phenology, altered population dynamics and 
changes in the composition of species assemblage or the 
structure and function of ecosystems, are evident {2.2.5.3.2, 
2.2.5.2.3, 2.2.6.2} and accelerating in marine, terrestrial and 
freshwater systems (well established) {2.2.3.2}. Almost half 
(47 per cent) of threatened terrestrial mammals, excluding 
bats, and one quarter (23 per cent) of threatened birds may 
have already been negatively affected by climate change in 
at least part of their distribution (birds in North America and 
Europe suggest effects of climate change in their population 
trends since the 1980s) (established but incomplete) 
{2.2.6.2}. Ecosystems such as tundra and taiga and regions 
such as Greenland, previously little affected by people 
directly, are increasingly experiencing the impacts of climate 
change (well established) {2.2.7.5}. Large reductions and 
local extinctions of populations are widespread (well 
established) {2.2.6.2}. This indicates that many species are 
unable to cope locally with the rapid pace of climate 
change, through either evolutionary or behavioural 
processes, and that their continued existence will also 
depend on the extent to which they are able to disperse, to 
track suitable climatic conditions, and to preserve their 
capacity to evolve (well established) {2.2.5.2.5}. Many of 
these changes can have significant impacts on a number of 
important economic sectors, and cascading effects for other 
components of biodiversity. Island nations, in particular 
those in East Asia and the Pacific region, will be most 
vulnerable to sea-level rise (1m) as projected by all climate 
change scenarios, {2.1.1.7.1} which will displace close to 
40 million people {2.1.1.7.1, 2.2.7.1.8}. 

 15 Unsustainable use of the Earth’s resources is 
underpinned by a set of demographic and economic 
indirect drivers that have increased, and that 
furthermore interact in complex ways, including 
through trade (well established) {2.1.6}. The global 
human population has increased from 3.7 to 7.6 billion since 
1970 unevenly across countries and regions, which has 
strong implications for the degradation of nature. Per capita 
consumption also has grown, and also is unequal, with wide 
variations in lifestyles and access to resources across and 
within regions, plus consequences for nature that are 
distributed globally through trade. Total gross domestic 
product is four times higher and is rising faster in developed 
than in least developed countries. Approximately 821 million 
people face food insecurity in Asia and Africa, while 40 per 
cent of the global population lacks access to clean, safe 
drinking water. Generally, environmentally-based health 
burdens, such as air and water pollution, are more prevalent 
in least developed countries {2.1.2, 2.1.15}.

 16 Due to expansions of infrastructure, extensive 
areas of the planet are being opened up to new 
threats (well established) {2.1.11}. Globally, paved road 
lengths are projected to increase by 25 million kilometres by

2050, with nine tenths of all road construction occurring 
within least developed and developing countries. The 
number of dams has increased rapidly in the past 50 years. 
Worldwide, there are now about 50,000 large dams (higher 
than 15 metres) and approximately 17 million reservoirs 
(larger than 0.01 hectares or 100m2) {2.1.11}. The 
expansions of roads, cities, hydroelectric dams and oil and 
gas pipelines can come with high environmental and social 
costs, including deforestation, habitat fragmentation, 
biodiversity loss, land grabbing, population displacement 
and social disruption, including for indigenous peoples and 
local communities (established but incomplete). Yet 
infrastructure can generate positive economic effects and 
even environmental gains, based on efficiency, innovation, 
migration, and urbanization, depending on where and how 
investment is implemented and governed (well established) 
{2.1.11}. Understanding this variation in impacts is critical.

 17 Long-distance transportation of goods and 
people, including for tourism, have grown dramatically 
in the past 20 years, with negative consequences for 
nature overall (established but incomplete). The rise in 
airborne and seaborne transportation of both goods and 
people, including a threefold increase in travel from 
developed and developing countries in particular, has 
increased pollution and significantly increased the presence 
of invasive alien species (well established) {2.1.15}. Between 
2009 and 2013, the carbon footprint from tourism rose 
40 per cent to 4.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide, and overall, 
8 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions are from 
tourism-related transportation and food consumption 
{2.1.11, 2.1.15}. The demand for nature-based tourism or 
ecotourism has also risen, with mixed effects on nature and 
local communities, including some potential for contributions 
to local conservation, in particular when carried out at a 
smaller scale {2.1.11}. 

 18 Distant areas of the world are increasingly 
connected, as consumption, production, and 
governance decisions increasingly influence 
materials, waste, energy, and information flows in 
other countries, generating aggregate economic gains 
while shifting economic and environmental costs, 
which can link to conflicts (established but 
incomplete) (Figure SPM.4). As per capita consumption 
has risen, developed countries and rapidly growing 
developing countries {2.1.2, 2.1.6}, while at times 
supporting efficient production for exports, often reduce 
water consumption and forest degradation nationally {2.1.6, 
2.1.11} by importing crops and other resources, mainly from 
developing countries {2.1.6}. The latter, as a result, see 
declines in nature and its contributions to people (habitat, 
climate, air and water quality) different from the exported 
food, fibre and timber products (Figures SPM.1 and 5). 
Reduced, declining and unequal access to nature’s 
contributions to people may, in a complex interaction with 

other factors, be a source of conflict within and among 
countries (established but incomplete). Least developed 
countries, often rich in and more dependent upon natural 
resources, have suffered the greatest land degradation, 
have also experienced more conflict and lower economic 
growth, and have contributed to environmental outmigration 
by several million people {2.1.2, 2.1.4}. When indigenous 
peoples or local communities are expelled from or 
threatened on their lands, including by mining or industrial 
logging for export, this too can spark conflict – often 
between actors with different levels of power, as today a few 
actors can control large shares of any market or capital 
asset rivalling those of most countries {2.1.6}, while funds 
channelled through tax havens support most vessels 
implicated in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. 
More than 2,500 conflicts over fossil fuels, water, food and 
land are currently occurring across the planet, and at least 
1,000 environmental activists and journalists were killed 
between 2002 and 2013 {2.1.11, 2.1.18}.

 19 Governance has at many levels moved slowly to 
further and better incorporate into policies and 
incentives the values of nature’s contributions to 
people. However, around the globe, subsidies with 
harmful effects on nature have persisted (well 
established) {2.1, 3, 5, 6.4}. The incorporation by society of 
the value of nature’s contributions to people will entail shifts 
in governance even within private supply chains, for instance 
when civil society certifies and helps to reward desired 
practices, or when States block access to markets because 
of undesirable practices {2.1.7}. Successful local governance 
supported by recognition of local rights has often 
incorporated knowledge of how nature contributes to human 
wellbeing to motivate such behaviours {2.1.8}. National 
agencies have also promoted land management strategies 
that are more sustainable and introduced regulations, among 
other policy measures {2.1.9.2}, and have coordinated with 
other nations on global agreements to maintain nature’s 
contributions to people {2.1.10}. Economic instruments that 
may be harmful to nature include subsidies, financial 
transfers, subsidized credit, tax abatements, and prices for 
commodities and industrial goods that hide environmental 
and social costs. Such instruments favour unsustainable 
production and, as a consequence, can promote 
deforestation, overfishing, urban sprawl, and wasteful uses of 
water. In 2015, agricultural support potentially harmful to 
nature amounted to $100 billion in countries belonging to the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 
although some subsidy reforms to reduce unsustainable 
pesticide uses and adjust several other consequential 
development practices have been introduced {2.1.9.1, 
6.4.5}. Fossil fuel subsidies valued at $345 billion result in 
global costs of $5 trillion when including the reduction of 
nature’s contributions (coal accounts for about half of these 
costs, petroleum for about one third and natural gas for 
about one tenth {2.1.9.1.2}). In fisheries, subsidies to

increase and maintain capacity, which in turn often lead to 
the degradation of nature, constitute perhaps a majority of 
the tens of US$ billions spent on supports {5.3.2.5}.

 20 Much of the world’s terrestrial wild and 
domesticated biodiversity lies in areas traditionally 
managed, owned, used or occupied by indigenous 
peoples and local communities (well established) 
(Figure SPM.5) {2.2.4}. In spite of efforts at all levels, 
although nature on indigenous lands is declining less 
rapidly than elsewhere, biodiversity and the 
knowledge associated with its management are still 

deteriorating (established but incomplete) {2.2.4, 
2.2.5.3}. Despite a long history of resource use, 
conservation conflicts related to colonial expansion and 
land appropriation for parks and other uses {3.2} (well 
established), indigenous peoples and local communities 
have often managed their landscapes and seascapes in 
ways that were adjusted to local conditions over 
generations. These management methods often remain 
compatible with, or actively support, biodiversity 
conservation by “accompanying” natural processes with 
anthropogenic assets (established but incomplete) {2.2.4, 
2.2.5.3.1} (Figure SPM.5).

Figure SPM 5  �Contributions of indigenous peoples and local communities to the enhancement 
and maintenance of wild and domesticated biodiversity and landscapes. 
Indigenous and local knowledge systems are locally based, but regionally 
manifested and thus globally relevant. 

A wide diversity of practices actively and positively contributes to wild and domestic biodiversity through “accompanying” natural 
processes with anthropogenic assets (knowledge, practices and technology). Indigenous peoples often manage the land and coastal 
areas based on culturally specific world views, applying principles and indicators such as the health of the land, caring for the country 
and reciprocal responsibility. As lifestyles, values and external pressures change with globalization, however, unsustainable practices 
are becoming increasingly common in certain regions10. The image in the centre of the above figure shows the global overlap between  
1) land areas traditionally owned, managed11, used, or occupied by indigenous peoples; 2) formally designated protected areas; 
and 3) remaining terrestrial areas with very low human intervention (areas that score <4 on the Human Footprint Index12). Circles and 
overlapping sections are proportional in area. Land areas traditionally owned, managed11, used, or occupied by indigenous peoples 
overlap with approximately 35 per cent of the area that is formally protected, and approximately 35 per cent of all remaining terrestrial 
areas with very low human intervention. The topics and pictures in the figure aim to illustrate, not represent, the types and diversity of 
the following contributions of indigenous peoples and local communities to biodiversity: a  domestication and maintenance of locally 
adapted crop and fruit varieties (potatoes, Peru) and b  animal breeds (rider and sheep, Kyrgyzstan) {2.2.4.4}; c  creation of species-
rich habitats and high ecosystem diversity in cultural landscapes (hay meadows, Central Europe) {2.2.4.1-2}; d  identification of useful 
plants and their cultivation in high-diversity ecosystems (multi-species forest garden, Indonesia) {2.2.4.3}; e  and f  management 
and monitoring of wild species, habitats and landscapes for wildlife and for increased resilience ( e  - Australia, f  - Alaska) {2.2.4.5-
6}; g  restoration of degraded lands (Niger) {3.2.4}; h  prevention of deforestation in recognized indigenous territories (Amazon basin, 
Brazil) {2.2.4.7}; i  offering alternative concepts of relations between humanity and nature (Northern Australia).

At least one quarter of the global land area is traditionally 
managed13, owned, used or occupied by indigenous 
peoples. These areas include approximately 35 per cent 
of the area that is formally protected, and approximately 
35 per cent of all remaining terrestrial areas with very 
low human intervention (established but incomplete) 
{2.2.5.3.1}. Community-based conservation institutions 
and local governance regimes have often been effective, 
at times even more effective than formally established 
protected areas, in preventing habitat loss (established but 
incomplete). Several studies have highlighted contributions 
by indigenous peoples and local communities in limiting 
deforestation, as well as initiatives showing synergies 
between these different mechanisms (well established) 
{6.3.2, 2.2.5.3}. In many regions, however, the lands of

that fulfils material and non-material cultural needs, including livelihood 
activities such as hunting, fishing, gathering, resource harvesting, 
pastoralism, and small-scale agriculture and horticulture.

indigenous peoples are becoming islands of biological 
and cultural diversity surrounded by areas in which nature 
has further deteriorated (established but incomplete) 
{2.2.5.3}. Among the local indicators developed and used 
by indigenous peoples and local communities, 72 per cent 
show negative trends in nature that underpinned local 
livelihoods (established but incomplete) {2.2.5.3.2}. Major 
trends include declining availability of resources – due 
in part to legal and illegal territory reductions, despite 
expanding indigenous populations – as well as declining 
health and populations of culturally important species; 
new pests and invasive alien species as climate changes; 
losses in both natural forest habitats and grazing lands; 
and declining productivity in remnant ecosystems. A more 
detailed global synthesis of trends in nature observed by 
indigenous peoples and local communities is hindered by 
the lack of institutions that gather data for these locations 
and then synthesize them within regional and global 
summaries {2.2.2}.

C.	 Goals for conserving and sustainably using nature 
and achieving sustainability cannot be met by current 
trajectories, and goals for 2030 and beyond may only 
be achieved through transformative changes14 across 
economic, social, political and technological factors.

 21 There has been good progress towards the 
components of 4 of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets 
under the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020. 
Moderate progress has been achieved towards some 
components of 7 more targets, but for 6 others, poor 
progress has been made towards all components. 
There is insufficient information to assess progress 
towards some or all components of the remaining 
3 targets (established but incomplete) {3.2}. Overall, 
the state of nature continues to decline (12 of 16 
indicators show significantly worsening trends) (well 
established) {3.2} (Figure SPM.6). 14

By 2015, greater progress had been made in implementing 
policy responses and actions to conserve biodiversity for 
drivers with an impact on coral reefs and other ecosystems 
vulnerable to climate change (established but incomplete) 
{3.2}. Anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss, including 
habitat loss as a result of land-use and sea use change 
(addressed by Aichi Target 5), unsustainable agriculture, 
aquaculture and forestry (Aichi Target 7), unsustainable 
fishing (Aichi Target 6), pollution (Aichi Target 8), and invasive 
alien species (Aichi Target 9) are increasing globally, despite

and social factors, including paradigms, goals and values.

national efforts to meet the Aichi Targets (established but 
incomplete) {3.2}.

 22 Conservation actions, including protected 
areas, efforts to manage unsustainable use and 
address the illegal capture and trade of species, and 
the translocation and eradication of invasive species, 
have been successful in preventing the extinction of 
some species (established but incomplete). For 
example, conservation investment during the period 
between 1996 and 2008 reduced the extinction risk for 
mammals and birds in 109 countries by a median value of 
29 per cent per country, while the rate of decrease in 
extinction risk for birds, mammals and amphibians would 
have been at least 20 per cent higher without conservation 
action in recent decades. Similarly, it is likely that at least 
6 species of ungulate (e.g., the Arabian Oryx and 
Przewalski’s Horse) would now be extinct or surviving only 
in captivity without conservation measures. At least 107 
highly threatened birds, mammals and reptiles (e.g., the 
Island Fox and the Seychelles Magpie-Robin) are estimated 
to have benefited from invasive mammal eradication on 
islands {3.2.2}. Although still few and spatially localized, 
such cases show that with prompt and appropriate action, it 
is possible to reduce human-induced extinction rates

(established but incomplete) {2.2.5.2.4, 4}. There are, 
however, few other counterfactual studies assessing how 
trends in the state of nature or pressures upon nature would 
have been different in the absence of conservation efforts 
(well established) {3.2}.

 23 Biodiversity and ecosystem functions and 
services directly underpin the achievement of several 
of the Sustainable Development Goals, including 
those on water and sanitation, climate action, life 
below water and life on land (Sustainable 
Development Goals 6, 13, 14 and 15), (well 
established) {3.3.2.1}. Nature also plays an important 
and complex role in the achievement of the 
Sustainable Development Goals related to poverty, 
hunger, health and well-being and sustainable cities 
(Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 3 and 11) 
(established but incomplete) {3.3.2.2} (Figure SPM.7). 
Several examples illustrate the interdependencies between 
nature and the Sustainable Development Goals. For 
example, nature and its contributions may play an important 
role in reducing vulnerability to climate-related extreme 
events and other economic, social and environmental 
shocks and disasters, although anthropogenic assets are 
also involved (established but incomplete). Nature’s 
underpinning of specific health targets varies across regions 
and ecosystems, is influenced by anthropogenic assets and 
remains understudied. The relationship can be positive or 
negative, as in the case of certain aspects of biodiversity 
and infectious diseases (see paragraph 2 of the present 
document). Nature directly underpins the livelihoods of 
indigenous peoples and local communities and the rural and 
urban poor, largely through direct consumption or through 
the income generated by trade in material contributions 
such as food (see paragraphs 2 and 36 of the present 
document) and energy (well established). Such contributions 
are generally underrepresented in poverty analyses 
(established but incomplete). Nature and its contributions 
are also relevant to the Goals for education, gender equality, 
reducing inequalities and promoting peace, justice and 
strong institutions (Sustainable Development Goals 4, 5, 10 

and 16), but the current focus and wording of the related 
targets obscures or omits their relationship to nature 
(established but incomplete).

 24 To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals 
and the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity, future targets are 
likely to be more effective if they take into account the 
impacts of climate change (well established) {3.2, 3.3}. 
For example, climate change is projected to greatly increase 
the number of species under threat, with fewer species 
expanding their ranges or experiencing more suitable 
climatic conditions than the number of species experiencing 
range contraction or less suitable conditions (established 
but incomplete) {4.2, 3.2}. The impact of climate change on 
the effectiveness of protected areas calls for a re-evaluation 
of conservation objectives; meanwhile, there are currently 
few protected areas whose objectives and management 
take climate change into account (established but 
incomplete). The Sustainable Development Goals for 
poverty, health, water and food security, and sustainability 
targets are closely linked through the impacts of multiple 
direct drivers, including climate change, on biodiversity and 
ecosystem functions and services, nature and nature’s 
contributions to people and good quality of life. In a 
post-2020 global biodiversity framework, placing greater 
emphasis on the interactions between the targets of the 
Sustainable Development Goals {4.6, 3.7} may provide a 
way forward for achieving multiple targets, as synergies (and 
trade-offs) can be considered. Future targets are expected 
to be more effective if they take into account the impacts of 
climate change, including on biodiversity, and action to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change {4.6, 3.7}.

 25 The adverse impacts of climate change on 
biodiversity are projected to increase with increasing 
warming, so limiting global warming to well below 2°C 
would have multiple co-benefits for nature and nature’s 
contributions to people and quality of life; however, it is 
projected that some large-scale land-based mitigation 
measures to achieve that objective will have 
significant impacts on biodiversity (established but

Scores are based on a quantitative analysis of indicators, a systematic review of the literature, the fifth National Reports to the 
Convention on Biological Diversity and the information available on countries’ stated intentions to implement additional actions by 
2020. Progress towards target elements is scored as “Good” (substantial positive trends at a global scale relating to most aspects 
of the element); “Moderate” (the overall global trend is positive, but insubstantial or insufficient, or there may be substantial positive 
trends for some aspects of the element, but little or no progress for others; or the trends are positive in some geographic regions, but 
not in others); “Poor” (little or no progress towards the element or movement away from it; or, despite local, national or case-specific 
successes and positive trends for some aspects, the overall global trend shows little or negative progress); or “Unknown” (insufficient 
information to score progress).

incomplete) {4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5}. All climate model 
trajectories show that limiting human-induced climate 
change to well below 2°C requires immediate, rapid 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or a reliance on 
substantial carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. 
However, the land areas required for bioenergy crops (with 
or without carbon capture and storage), afforestation and 
reforestation to achieve the targeted carbon uptake rates 
are projected to be very large {4.2.4.3., 4.5.3}. The 
biodiversity and environmental impact of large-scale 
afforestation and reforestation depends to a large degree on 
where these occur (prior vegetation cover, state of 
degradation), and the tree species planted (established but 
incomplete). Likewise, large bioenergy crop or afforested 
areas are expected to compete with areas set aside for 
conservation, including restoration, or agriculture 
(established but incomplete). Consequently, large-scale 
land-based mitigation measures may jeopardize the 
achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals that 
depend on land resources (well established) {4.5.3}. In 
contrast, the benefits of avoiding and reducing deforestation 
and promoting restoration can be significant for biodiversity 
(well established) and are expected to have co-benefits for 
local communities (established but incomplete) {4.2.4.3}.

 26 Biodiversity and nature’s regulating contributions 
to people are projected to decline further in most 
scenarios of global change over the coming decades, 
while the supply and demand for nature’s material 
contributions to people that have current market value 
(food, feed, timber and bioenergy) are projected to 
increase (well established) {4.2, 4.3} (for example, see 
Figure SPM.8). These changes arise from continued human 
population growth, increasing purchasing power, and 
increasing per capita consumption. The projected effects of 
climate change and land use change on terrestrial and 
freshwater biodiversity are mostly negative, increase with the 
degree of global warming and land use change, and have an 
impact on marine biodiversity through increased 
eutrophication and deoxygenation of coastal waters (well 
established) {4.2.2.3.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4}. For instance, a 
synthesis of many studies estimates that the fraction of 
species at risk of extinction due to climate change is 5 per 
cent at 2°C warming, rising to 16 per cent at 4.3°C warming 
{4.2.1.1}. Climate change and business-as-usual fishing 
scenarios are expected to worsen the status of marine 

biodiversity (well established) {4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.3.1}. Climate 
change alone is projected to decrease ocean net primary 
production by between 3 and 10 per cent, and fish biomass 
by between 3 and 25 per cent (in low and high warming 
scenarios, respectively) by the end of the century (established 
but incomplete) {4.2.2.2.1}. Whether or not the current 
removal of nearly 30 per cent of anthropogenic carbon 
dioxide emissions by terrestrial ecosystems continues into the 
future varies greatly from one scenario to the next and 
depends heavily on how climate change, atmospheric carbon 
dioxide and land-use change interact. Important regulating 
contributions of nature, such as coastal and soil protection, 
crop pollination and carbon storage, are projected to decline 
(established but incomplete) {4.2.4, 4.3.2.1}. In contrast, 
substantial increases in food, feed, timber and bioenergy 
production are predicted in most scenarios (well established) 
{4.2.4, 4.3.2.2}. Scenarios that include substantial shifts 
towards sustainable management of resource exploitation 
and land use, market reform, globally equitable and moderate 
animal protein consumption, and reduction of food waste and 
losses result in low loss or even recovery of biodiversity (well 
established) {4.2.2.3.1, 4.2.4.2, 4.3.2.2, 4.5.3}.

 27 The magnitude of the impacts on biodiversity and 
ecosystem functions and services and the differences 
between regions are smaller in scenarios that focus on 
global or regional sustainability (well established) 
(Figure SPM.8). Sustainability scenarios that explore 
moderate and equitable consumption result in substantially 
lower negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems due 
to food, feed and timber production (well established) {4.1.3, 
4.2.4.2, 4.3.2, 4.5.3}. The general patterns at the global level 
– namely, declines in biodiversity and regulating contributions 
versus increases in the production of food, bioenergy and 
materials – are evident in nearly all subregions {4.2.2, 4.2.3, 
4.2.4, 4.3.3}. For terrestrial systems, most studies indicate 
that South America, Africa and parts of Asia will be much 
more significantly affected than other regions, especially in 
scenarios that are not based on sustainability objectives (see 
Figure SPM.8 as an example). That is due in part to regional 
climate change differences and in part to the fact that 
scenarios generally foresee the largest land use conversions 
to crops or bioenergy in those regions {4.1.5, 4.2.4.2}. 
Regions such as North America and Europe are expected to 
have low conversion to crops and continued reforestation 
{4.1.5, 4.2.4.2}.

an assessment of the evidence of the links between nature and the Sustainable Development Goals. The scores for the targets are 
based on a systematic assessment of the literature and a quantitative analysis of the indicators, where possible. None of the targets 
scored “Full support” (that is, having a good status or substantial positive trends on a global scale). Consequently, the score of “Full 
support” was not included in the table. “Partial support” means that the overall global status and trends are positive, but still insubstantial 
or insufficient; or there may be substantial positive trends for some relevant aspects, but negative trends for others; or the trends are 
positive in some geographic regions, but negative in others. “Poor/Declining support” indicates poor status or substantial negative trends 
at a global scale. “Uncertain relationship” means that the relationship between nature and/or nature’s contributions to people and the 
achievement of the target is uncertain. “Unknown” indicates that there is insufficient information to score the status and trends.

Figure SPM 8  �Projections of the impacts of land use and climate change on biodiversity and 
nature’s material and regulating contributions to people between 2015 and 2050.  

This figure illustrates three main messages: i) the impacts on biodiversity and on nature’s contributions to people (NCP) are the lowest 
in the “global sustainability” scenario in nearly all sub-regions, ii) regional differences in impacts are high in the regional competition 
and economic optimism scenario, and iii) material NCP increase the most in the regional competition and economic optimism 
scenarios, but this comes at the expense of biodiversity and regulating NCP. Projected impacts are based on a subset of the Shared 
Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and greenhouse gas emissions trajectories (RCP) developed in support of Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change assessments. This figure does not cover the scenarios that include transformative change that are 
discussed in Chapter 5.

•	 The “Global sustainability” scenario combines proactive environmental policy and sustainable production and consumption with 
low greenhouse gas emissions (SSP1, RCP2.6; top rows in each panel); 

•	 The “Regional competition” scenario combines strong trade and other barriers and a growing gap between rich and poor with 
high emissions (SSP3, RCP6.0; middle rows); and 

•	 The “Economic optimism” scenario combines rapid economic growth and low environmental regulation with very high 
greenhouse emissions (SSP5, RCP8.5; bottom rows). 

Multiple models were used with each of the scenarios to generate the first rigorous global-scale model comparison estimating the 
impact on biodiversity (change in species richness across a wide range of terrestrial plant and animal species at regional scales; 
orange bars), material NCP (food, feed, timber and bioenergy: purple bars) and regulating NCP (nitrogen retention, soil protection, 
crop pollination, crop pest control and ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration: white bars). The bars represent the normalized 
means of multiple models and the whiskers indicate the standard errors. The global means of percentage changes in individual 
indicators can be found in Figure 4.2.14. 

 28 Climate change impacts also play a major role in 
regionally-differentiated projections of biodiversity 
and ecosystem functioning in both marine and 
terrestrial systems. Novel communities, where 
species will co-occur in historically unknown 
combinations, are expected to emerge (established 
but incomplete) {4.2.1.2, 4.2.4.1} Substantial climate 
change-driven shifts of terrestrial biome boundaries, in 
particular in boreal, subpolar and polar regions and in (semi-)
arid environments, are projected for the coming decades; a 
warmer, drier climate will reduce productivity in many places 
(well established) {4.2.4.1}. In contrast, rising atmospheric 
carbon dioxide concentrations can be beneficial for net 
primary productivity and can enhance woody vegetation 
cover, especially in semi-arid regions (established but 
incomplete) {4.2.4.1}. For marine systems, impacts are 
expected to be geographically variable, with many fish 

populations projected to move poleward due to ocean 
warming, meaning that local species extinctions are 
expected in the tropics (well established) {4.2.2.2.1}. 
However, that does not necessarily imply an increase in 
biodiversity in the polar seas, because of the rapid rate of 
sea ice retreat and the enhanced ocean acidification of cold 
waters (established but incomplete) {4.2.2.2.4}. Along 
coastlines, the upsurge in extreme climatic events, sea level 
rise and coastal development are expected to cause 
increased fragmentation and loss of habitats. Coral reefs are 
projected to undergo more frequent extreme warming 
events, with less recovery time in between, declining by a 
further 70–90 per cent at global warming of 1.5°C, and by 
more than 99 per cent at warming of 2°C, causing massive 
bleaching episodes with high coral mortality rates (well 
established) {4.2.2.2.2}. 

D.	Nature can be conserved, restored and used sustainably 
while simultaneously meeting other global societal 
goals through urgent and concerted efforts fostering 
transformative change.

 29 The Sustainable Development Goals and the 
2050 Vision for Biodiversity cannot be achieved 
without transformative change, the conditions for 
which can be put in place now (well established) {2, 3, 
5, 6.2} (Figure SPM.9). Increasing awareness of 
interconnectedness in the context of the environmental crisis 
and new norms regarding interactions between humans and 
nature would support that change (well established) {5.3, 
5.4.3}. In the short term (before 2030), all decision makers 
could contribute to sustainability transformations, including 
through enhanced and improved implementation and 
enforcement of effective existing policy instruments and 
regulations, and the reform and removal of harmful existing 
policies and subsidies (well established). Additional 

measures are necessary to enable transformative change 
over the long term (up to 2050) to address the indirect 
drivers that are the root causes of the deterioration of nature 
(well established), including changes in social, economic 
and technological structures within and across nations {6.2, 
6.3, 6.4} (SPM Table.1).

 30 Sustainability transformations call for cross-
sectoral thinking and approaches (Figure SPM.9). 
Sectoral policies and measures can be effective in 
particular contexts, but often fail to account for 
indirect, distant and cumulative impacts, which can 
have adverse effects, including the exacerbation of 
inequalities (well established). Cross-sectoral

approaches, including landscape approaches, integrated 
watershed and coastal zone management, marine spatial 
planning, bioregional scale planning for energy, and new 
urban planning paradigms offer opportunities to reconcile 
multiple interests, values and forms of resource use, provided 
that these cross-sectoral approaches recognize trade-offs 
and uneven power relations between stakeholders 
(established but incomplete) {5.4.2, 5.4.3, 6.3, 6.4}.

 31 Transformative change is facilitated by 
innovative governance approaches that incorporate 
existing approaches, such as integrative, inclusive, 
informed and adaptive governance. While such 
approaches have been extensively practised and 
studied separately, it is increasingly recognized that 
together, they can contribute to transformative 
change (established but incomplete) {6.2}. They help to 
address governance challenges that are common to many 
sectors and policy domains and create the conditions for 
implementing transformative change. Integrative 

approaches, such as mainstreaming across government 
sectors, are focused on the relationships between sectors 
and policies and help to ensure policy coherence and 
effectiveness (well established). Inclusive approaches help to 
reflect a plurality of values and ensure equity (established 
but incomplete), including through equitable sharing of 
benefits arising from their use and rights-based approaches 
(established but incomplete). Informed governance entails 
novel strategies for knowledge production and co-
production that are inclusive of diverse values and 
knowledge systems (established but incomplete). Adaptive 
approaches, including learning from experience, monitoring 
and feedback loops, contribute to preparing for and 
managing the inevitable uncertainties and complexities 
associated with social and environmental changes 
(established but incomplete) {6.2, 5.4.2}.

 32 A summary of the evidence related to the 
components of pathways to sustainability suggests 
that there are five overarching types of management 

Figure SPM 9  �Transformative change in global sustainability pathways.

Collaborative implementation of priority governance interventions (levers) targeting key points of intervention (leverage points) could 
enable transformative change from current trends towards more sustainable ones. Most levers can be applied at multiple leverage 
points by a range of actors, such as intergovernmental organizations, governments, non-governmental organizations, citizen and 
community groups, indigenous peoples and local communities, donor agencies, science and educational organizations, and the 
private sector, depending on the context. Implementing existing and new instruments through place-based governance interventions 
that are integrative, informed, inclusive and adaptive, using strategic policy mixes and learning from feedback, could enable global 
transformation.

interventions, or levers, and eight leverage points that 
are key for achieving transformative change (Figure 
SPM.9; D3 and D4 above) {5.4.1, 5.4.2}. The notion of 
levers and leverage points recognizes that complex global 
systems cannot be managed simply, but that in certain 
cases, specific interventions can be mutually reinforcing and 
can generate larger-scale changes towards achieving 
shared goals (well established) (Table SPM.1). For 
example, changes in laws and policies can enable and 
underpin changes in resource management and 
consumption, and in turn, changes in individual and 
collective behaviour and habits can facilitate the 
implementation of policies and laws {5.4.3}.

 33 Changes towards sustainable production and 
consumption and towards reducing and transforming 
residues and waste, particularly changes in 
consumption among the affluent, is recognized by 
some individuals and communities worldwide as 
central to sustainable development and reducing 
inequalities. While actual reductions have been 
limited, actions already being taken at different levels 
can be improved, coordinated and scaled up (well 
established). Those include introducing and improving 
standards, systems and relevant regulations aimed at 
internalizing the external costs of production, extraction and 
consumption (such as pricing wasteful or polluting practices, 
including through penalties); promoting resource efficiency 
and circular and other economic models; voluntary 
environmental and social certification of market chains; and 
incentives that promote sustainable practices and 
innovation. Importantly, they also involve a change in the 
definition of what a good quality of life entails – decoupling 
the idea of a good and meaningful life from ever-increasing 
material consumption. All those approaches are more 
effective when they are mutually reinforcing. Actions that 
help to voluntarily unleash existing social values of 
responsibility in the form of individual, collective and 
organizational actions towards sustainability can have a 
powerful and lasting effect in shifting behaviour and 
cultivating stewardship as a normal social practice 
(established but incomplete) {5.4.1.2, 5.4.1.3, 6.4.2, 6.4.3}. 

 34 Expanding and effectively managing the current 
network of protected areas, including terrestrial, 
freshwater and marine areas, is important for 
safeguarding biodiversity (well established), 
particularly in the context of climate change. 
Conservation outcomes also depend on adaptive 
governance, strong societal engagement, effective 
and equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms, sustained 
funding, and monitoring and enforcement of rules 
(well established) {6.2, 5.4.2}. National Governments play 
a central role in supporting primary research, effective 
conservation and the sustainable use of multi-functional 
landscapes and seascapes. This entails planning 

ecologically representative networks of interconnected 
protected areas to cover key biodiversity areas and 
managing trade-offs between societal objectives that 
represent diverse worldviews and multiple values of nature 
(established but incomplete) {6.3.2.3, 6.3.3.3}. Safeguarding 
protected areas into the future also entails enhancing 
monitoring and enforcement systems, managing 
biodiversity-rich land and sea beyond protected areas, 
addressing property rights conflicts and protecting 
environmental legal frameworks against the pressure of 
powerful interest groups. In many areas, conservation 
depends on building capacity and enhancing stakeholder 
collaboration, involving non-profit groups as well as 
indigenous peoples and local communities to establish and 
manage marine protected areas and marine protected area 
networks, and proactively using instruments such as 
landscape-scale and seascape-scale participatory scenarios 
and spatial planning, including transboundary conservation 
planning (well established) {5.3.2.3, 6.3.2.3, 6.3.3.3}. 
Implementation beyond protected areas includes combating 
wildlife and timber trafficking through effective enforcement 
and ensuring the legality and sustainability of trade in wildlife. 
Such actions include prioritizing the prosecution of wildlife 
trafficking in criminal justice systems, using community-
based social marketing to reduce demand and 
implementing strong measures to combat corruption at all 
levels (established but incomplete) {6.3.2.3}.

 35 Integrated landscape governance entails a mix of 
policies and instruments that together ensure nature 
conservation, ecological restoration and sustainable 
use, sustainable production (including of food, 
materials and energy), and sustainable forest 
management and infrastructure planning, and that 
address the major drivers of biodiversity loss and 
nature deterioration (well established) {6.3.2, 6.3.6}. 
Policy mixes that are harmonized across sectors, levels of 
governance and jurisdictions can account for ecological and 
social differences across and beyond the landscape, build 
on existing forms of knowledge and governance and 
address trade-offs between tangible and non-tangible 
benefits in a transparent and equitable manner (established 
but incomplete). Sustainable landscape management can 
be better achieved through multifunctional, multi-use, 
multi-stakeholder and community-based approaches (well 
established), using a combination of measures and 
practices, including: (a) well-managed and connected 
protected areas and other effective area-based conservation 
measures; (b) reduced impact logging, forest certification, 
payment for ecosystem services, among other instruments, 
and reduced emissions from deforestation and forest 
degradation; (c) support for ecological restoration; 
(d) effective monitoring, including public access and 
participation as appropriate; (e) addressing illegal activities; 
(f) the effective implementation of multilateral environmental 
agreements and other relevant international agreements by

their parties; and (g) promoting sustainable, biodiversity-
based food systems (well established) {6.3.2.1, 6.3.2.3, 
6.3.2, 6.3.2.4}.

 36 Feeding the world in a sustainable manner, 
especially in the context of climate change and 
population growth, entails food systems that ensure 
adaptive capacity, minimize environmental impacts, 
eliminate hunger, and contribute to human health and 
animal welfare (established but incomplete) {5.3.2.1, 
6.3.2.1}. Pathways to sustainable food systems entail 
land-use planning and sustainable management of 
both the supply/producer and the demand/consumer 
sides of food systems (well established) {5.3.2.1, 
6.3.2.1, 6.4}. Options for sustainable agricultural production 
are available and continue to be developed, with some 
having more impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem 
functions than others {6.3.2.1}. These options include 
integrated pest and nutrient management, organic 
agriculture, agroecological practices, soil and water 
conservation practices, conservation agriculture, 
agroforestry, silvopastoral systems, irrigation management, 
small or patch systems and practices to improve animal 
welfare. These practices could be enhanced through 
well-structured regulations, incentives and subsidies, the 
removal of distorting subsidies {2.3.5.2, 5.3.2.1, 5.4.2.1, 
6.3.2}, and – at landscape scales – by integrated landscape 
planning and watershed management. Ensuring the 
adaptive capacity of food production entails the use of 
measures that conserve the diversity of genes, varieties, 
cultivars, breeds, landraces and species, which also 
contributes to diversified, healthy and culturally-relevant 
nutrition. Some incentives and regulations may contribute to 
positive changes at both the production and consumption 
ends of supply chains, such as the creation, improvement 
and implementation of voluntary standards, certification and 
supply-chain agreements (e.g., the Soy Moratorium) and the 
reduction of harmful subsidies. Regulatory mechanisms 
could also address the risks of co-option and lobbying, 
where commercial or sectoral interests may work to 
maintain high levels of demand, monopolies and continued 
use of pesticides and chemical inputs {5.3.2.1}. Non-
regulatory alternatives are also important, and potentially 
include technical assistance – especially for small-holders – 
and appropriate economic incentive programs, for example, 
some payment for ecosystem services programmes and 
other non-monetary instruments {5.4.2.1}. Options that 
address and engage other actors in food systems (including 
the public sector, civil society, consumers and grassroots 
movements) include participatory on-farm research, the 
promotion of low-impact and healthy diets and the 
localization of food systems. Such options could help 
reduce food waste, overconsumption, and the demand for 
animal products that are produced unsustainably, which 
could have synergistic benefits for human health 
(established but incomplete) {5.3.2.1, 6.3.2.1}.

 37 Ensuring sustainable food production from the 
oceans while protecting biodiversity entails policy 
action to apply sustainable ecosystem approaches to 
fisheries management; spatial planning (including the 
implementation and expansion of marine protected 
areas); and more broadly, policy action to address 
drivers such as climate change and pollution (well 
established) {5.3.2.5, 6.3.3}. Scenarios show that the 
pathways to sustainable fisheries entail conserving, restoring 
and sustainably using marine ecosystems, rebuilding 
overfished stocks (including through targeted limits on 
catches or fishing efforts and moratoria), reducing pollution 
(including plastics), managing destructive extractive 
activities, eliminating harmful subsidies and illegal, 
unreported and unregulated fishing, adapting fisheries 
management to climate change impacts and reducing the 
environmental impact of aquaculture (well established) {4, 
5.3.2.5, 6.3.3.3.2}. Marine protected areas have 
demonstrated success in both biodiversity conservation and 
improved local quality of life when managed effectively and 
can be further expanded through larger or more 
interconnected protected areas or new protected areas in 
currently underrepresented regions and key biodiversity 
areas (established but incomplete) {5.3.2.5; 6.3.3.3.1}. Due 
to major pressures on coasts (including from development, 
land reclamation and water pollution), implementing marine 
conservation initiatives, such as integrated coastal planning, 
outside of protected areas is important for biodiversity 
conservation and sustainable use (well established) 
{6.3.3.3}. Other measures to expand multi-sectoral 
cooperation on coastal management include corporate 
social responsibility measures, standards for building and 
construction, and eco-labelling (well established) {6.3.3.3.2, 
6.3.3.3.4}. Additional tools could include both non-market 
and market-based economic instruments for financing 
conservation, including for example payment for ecosystem 
services, biodiversity offset schemes, blue-carbon 
sequestration, cap-and-trade programmes, green bonds 
and trust funds and new legal instruments, such as the 
proposed international, legally binding instrument on the 
conservation and sustainable use of marine biological 
diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction under the 
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 
(established but incomplete) {6.3.3.2, 6.3.3.1.3, 
5.4.2.1, 5.4.1.7}.

 38 Sustaining freshwater in the context of climate 
change, rising demand for water extraction and 
increased levels of pollution involves both cross-
sectoral and sector-specific interventions that 
improve water-use efficiency, increase storage, 
reduce sources of pollution, improve water quality, 
minimize disruption and foster the restoration of 
natural habitats and flow regimes (well established) 
{6.3.4}. Promising interventions include practising integrated 
water resource management and landscape planning across

scales; protecting wetland biodiversity areas; guiding and 
limiting the expansion of unsustainable agriculture and 
mining; slowing and reversing the de-vegetation of 
catchments; and mainstreaming practices that reduce 
erosion, sedimentation, and pollution run-off and minimize 
the negative impact of dams (well established) {6.3.4.6}. 
Sector-specific interventions include improved water-use 
efficiency techniques (including in agriculture, mining and 
energy), decentralized rainwater collection (for example, 
household-based), integrated management of surface and 
groundwater (e.g., “conjunctive use”), locally-developed 
water conservation techniques, and water pricing and 
incentive programmes (such as water accounts and 
payment for ecosystem services programmes) {6.3.4.2, 
6.3.4.4}. With regard to watershed payment for ecosystem 
services programmes, their effectiveness and efficiency can 
be enhanced by acknowledging multiple values in their 
design, implementation and evaluation and setting up 
impact evaluation systems (established but incomplete) 
{6.3.4.4}. Investment in infrastructure, including in green 
infrastructure, is important, especially in developing 
countries, but it can be undertaken in a way that takes into 
account ecological functions and the careful blending of built 
and natural infrastructure {5.3.2.4, 6.3.4.5}.

 39 Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals in 
cities and making cities resilient to climate change 
entails solutions that are sensitive to social, economic 
and ecological contexts. Integrated city-specific and 
landscape-level planning, nature-based solutions and 
built infrastructure, and responsible production and 
consumption can all contribute to sustainable and 
equitable cities and make a significant contribution to 
the overall climate change adaptation and mitigation 
effort. Urban planning approaches to promote sustainability 
include encouraging compact communities, designing 
nature-sensitive road networks and creating low-impact 
infrastructure and transportation systems (from an emissions 
and land-use perspective), including active, public and 
shared transport {5.3.2.6, 6.3.5}. However, given that most 
urban growth between now and 2030 will take place in the 
Global South, major sustainability challenges include 
creatively and inclusively addressing the lack of basic 
infrastructure (water, sanitation and mobility), the absence of 
spatial planning, and the limited governance capacity and 
financing mechanisms. Those challenges also offer 
opportunities for locally-developed innovation and 
experimentation, which will create new economic 
opportunities. A combination of bottom-up and city-level 
efforts through public, private, community and Government 
partnerships, can be effective in promoting low-cost and 
locally-adapted solutions to maintaining and restoring 
biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. 
Nature-based options include combining grey and green 
infrastructure (such as wetland and watershed restoration 
and green roofs), enhancing green spaces through 

restoration and expansion, promoting urban gardens, 
maintaining and designing for ecological connectivity, and 
promoting accessibility for all (with benefits for human 
health). Additional solutions include disseminating new, 
low-cost technologies for decentralized wastewater 
treatment and energy production and creating incentives to 
reduce over-consumption {6.3.5}. Integrating cross-sectoral 
planning at the local, landscape and regional levels is 
important, as is involving diverse stakeholders (well 
established). Particularly important at the regional scale are 
policies and programmes that promote sustainability-
minded collective action {5.4.1.3}, protect watersheds 
beyond city jurisdictions and ensure the connectivity of 
ecosystems and habitats (e.g., through green belts). At the 
regional scale, cross-sectoral approaches to mitigating the 
impact of infrastructure and energy projects entail support 
for comprehensive environmental impact assessments and 
strategic environmental assessments of local and regional 
cumulative impacts {6.3.6.4, 6.3.6.6}. 

 40 Decision makers have a range of options and 
tools for improving the sustainability of economic and 
financial systems (well established) {6.4}. Achieving a 
sustainable economy involves making fundamental 
reforms to economic and financial systems and 
tackling poverty and inequality as vital parts of 
sustainability (well established) {6.4}. Governments 
could reform subsidies and taxes to support nature and its 
contributions to people, removing perverse incentives and 
instead promoting diverse instruments such as payments 
linked to social and environmental metrics, as appropriate 
(established but incomplete) {6.4.1}. At the international 
level, options for reacting to the challenges generated by the 
displacement of the impacts of unsustainable consumption 
and production on nature include both rethinking 
established instruments and developing new instruments to 
account for long-distance impacts. Trade agreements and 
derivatives markets could be reformed to promote equity 
and prevent the deterioration of nature, although there are 
uncertainties associated with implementation (established 
but incomplete) {6.4.4}. Alternative models and measures of 
economic welfare (such as inclusive wealth accounting, 
natural capital accounting and degrowth models) are 
increasingly considered as possible approaches to 
balancing economic growth and the conservation of nature 
and its contributions and to recognizing trade-offs, the 
pluralism of values, and long-term goals (established but 
incomplete) {6.4.5}. Structural changes to economies are 
also key to shifting action over long timescales. Such 
changes include technological and social innovation regimes 
and investment frameworks that internalize environmental 
impacts, such as the externalities of economic activities, 
including by addressing environmental impacts in socially 
just and appropriate ways (well established) {5.4.1.7}. 
Although such market-based policy instruments as 
payments for ecosystem services, voluntary certification and

biodiversity offsetting have increased in use, their 
effectiveness is mixed, and they are often contested; thus, 
they should be carefully designed and applied to avoid 
perverse effects in context (established but incomplete) 
{5.4.2.1, 6.3.2.2, 6.3.2.5, 6.3.6.3}. The widespread 

internalization of environmental impacts, including 
externalities associated with long-distance trade, is 
considered both an outcome and a component of national 
and global sustainable economies (well established) 
{5.4.1.6, 6.4}.

APPENDIX 1
Conceptual framework and 
definitions

Figure SPM A1. The IPBES Conceptual Framework is 
a highly simplified model of the complex interactions 
between the natural world and human societies. The 
model identifies the main elements (boxes within the main 
panel outlined in grey), together with their interactions (arrows 
in the main panel), that are most relevant to the Platform’s 
goal. “Nature”, “nature’s contributions to people” and “good 
quality of life” (indicated as black headlines and defined in 
each corresponding box) are inclusive categories that were 
identified as meaningful and relevant to all stakeholders 
involved in IPBES during a participatory process, including 
various disciplines of the natural and social sciences and 
the humanities, and other knowledge systems, such as 

those of indigenous peoples and local communities. Text in 
green denotes scientific concepts, and text in blue denotes 
concepts originating in other knowledge systems. The solid 
arrows in the main panel denote influence between elements, 
and dotted arrows denote links that are acknowledged as 
important, but that are not the main focus of the Platform. The 
thick coloured arrows below and to the right of the central 
panel indicate the scales of time and space, respectively. 
This conceptual framework was accepted by the Plenary in 
decision IPBES-2/4, and the Plenary took note of an update 
presented in IPBES/5/INF/24 and in decision IPBES-5/1. 
Further details and examples of the concepts defined in the 
box can be found in the glossary and in Chapter 1.

Nature, in the context of the Platform, refers to the natural 
world, with an emphasis on biodiversity. Within the context 
of science, it includes categories such as biodiversity, 
ecosystems, ecosystem functioning, evolution, the 
biosphere, humankind’s shared evolutionary heritage, and 
biocultural diversity. Within the context of other knowledge 
systems, it includes categories such as Mother Earth 
and systems of life. Other components of nature, such 
as deep aquifers, mineral and fossil reserves, and wind, 
solar, geothermal and wave power, are not the focus of 
the Platform. Nature contributes to societies through the 
provision of contributions to people. 

Anthropogenic assets refers to built-up infrastructure, 
health facilities, knowledge (including indigenous and local 
knowledge systems and technical or scientific knowledge, 
as well as formal and non-formal education), technology 
(both physical objects and procedures), and financial assets, 
among others. Anthropogenic assets have been highlighted 
to emphasize that a good life is achieved by a co-production 
of benefits between nature and societies. 

Nature’s contributions to people refers to all the 
contributions that humanity obtains from nature. Ecosystem 
goods and services, considered separately or in bundles, 
are included in this category. Within other knowledge 
systems, nature’s gifts and similar concepts refer to the 
benefits of nature from which people derive good quality 
of life. Aspects of nature that can be negative to people 
(detriments), such as pests, pathogens or predators, are 
also included in this broad category.

Nature’s regulating contributions to people refers 
to functional and structural aspects of organisms and 
ecosystems that modify the environmental conditions 
experienced by people, and/or sustain and/or regulate the 
generation of material and non-material contributions. For 
example, these contributions include water purification, 
climate regulation and the regulation of soil erosion.

Nature’s material contributions to people refers to 
substances, objects or other material elements from 
nature that sustain people’s physical existence and the 
infrastructure (i.e. the basic physical and organizational 
structures and facilities, such as buildings, roads, power 
supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise. 
They are typically physically consumed in the process of 
being experienced, such as when plants or animals are 
transformed into food, energy, or materials for shelter or 
ornamental purposes.

Nature’s non-material contributions to people refers to 
nature’s contribution to people’s subjective or psychological 
quality of life, individually and collectively. The entities that 
provide these intangible contributions can be physically 
consumed in the process (e.g., animals in recreational 

or ritual fishing or hunting) or not (e.g., individual trees or 
ecosystems as sources of inspiration). 

Drivers of change refers to all those external factors that 
affect nature, anthropogenic assets, nature’s contributions 
to people and good quality of life. They include institutions 
and governance systems and other indirect drivers, and 
direct drivers (both natural and anthropogenic).

Institutions and governance systems and other 
indirect drivers are the ways in which societies 
organize themselves and the resulting influences on 
other components. They are the underlying causes of 
environmental change that are exogenous to the ecosystem 
in question. Because of their central role, influencing all 
aspects of human relationships with nature, they are key 
levers for decision-making. “Institutions” encompasses 
all formal and informal interactions among stakeholders 
and the social structures that determine how decisions 
are taken and implemented, how power is exercised, and 
how responsibilities are distributed. To varying degrees, 
institutions determine the access to and control, allocation 
and distribution of the components of nature and of 
anthropogenic assets and their contributions to people. 
Examples of institutions are systems of property and 
access rights to land (e.g., public, common-pool or private), 
legislative arrangements, treaties, informal social norms 
and rules, including those emerging from indigenous and 
local knowledge systems, and international regimes such 
as agreements against stratospheric ozone depletion or 
for the protection of endangered species of wild fauna and 
flora. Economic policies, including macroeconomic, fiscal, 
monetary or agricultural policies, play a significant role in 
influencing people’s decisions and behaviour and the way 
in which they relate to nature in the pursuit of benefits. 
However, many of the drivers of human behaviour and 
preferences, which reflect different perspectives on a good 
quality of life, work largely outside the market system. 

Direct drivers, both natural and anthropogenic, affect 
nature directly. “Natural drivers” are those that are not 
the result of human activities and are beyond human 
control. These include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and 
tsunamis, extreme weather or ocean-related events such 
as prolonged drought or cold periods, tropical cyclones 
and floods, the El Niño/La Niña Southern Oscillation 
and extreme tidal events. The direct anthropogenic 
drivers are those that are the result of human decisions, 
namely, of institutions and governance systems and other 
indirect drivers. Anthropogenic drivers include habitat 
conversion, e.g., degradation of land and aquatic habitats, 
deforestation and afforestation, exploitation of wild 
populations, climate change, pollution of soil, water and 
air and species introductions. Some of these drivers, such 
as pollution, can have negative impacts on nature; others, 
as in the case of habitat restoration, or the introduction

of a natural enemy to combat invasive species, can have 
positive effects. 

Good quality of life is the achievement of a fulfilled human 
life, a notion which varies strongly across different societies 
and groups within societies. It is a context-dependent state 
of individuals and human groups, comprising access to 
food, water, energy and livelihood security, and also health, 
good social relationships and equity, security, cultural 
identity, and freedom of choice and action. From virtually 
all standpoints, a good quality of life is multidimensional, 
having material as well as immaterial and spiritual 

components. What a good quality of life entails, however, is 
highly dependent on place, time and culture, with different 
societies espousing different views of their relationships 
with nature and placing different levels of importance on 
collective versus individual rights, the material versus the 
spiritual domain, intrinsic versus instrumental values, and 
the present time versus the past or the future. The concept 
of human well-being used in many western societies and its 
variants, together with those of living in harmony with nature 
and living well in balance and harmony with Mother Earth, 
are examples of different perspectives on a good quality 
of life.

In this assessment, the degree of confidence in each main 
finding is based on the quantity and quality of evidence 
and the level of agreement regarding that evidence (Figure 
SPM.A2). The evidence includes data, theory, models 
and expert judgement. Further details of the approach 
are documented in the note by the secretariat on the 
information on work related to the guide on the production 
of assessments (IPBES/6/INF/17).

The Intergovernmental Science-
Policy Platform on Biodiversity 
and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)
is the intergovernmental body which assesses the state of biodiversity and 
ecosystem services, in response to requests from Governments, the private 
sector and civil society.

The mission of IPBES is to strengthen the science-policy interface for 
biodiversity and ecosystem services for the conservation and sustainable 
use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainable 
development.

IPBES has a collaborative partnership arrangement with UNEP, UNESCO, 
FAO and UNDP. Its secretariat is hosted by the German government and 
located on the UN campus, in Bonn, Germany.

Scientists from all parts of the world contribute to the work of IPBES on a 
voluntary basis. They are nominated by their government or an organisation, 
and selected by the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel (MEP) of IPBES. Peer 
review forms a key component of the work of IPBES to ensure that a range 
of views is reflected in its work, and that the work is complete to the highest 
scientific standards.
