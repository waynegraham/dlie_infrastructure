Summary
About the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 

The 2024 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) 
analyses the climate strategies of 51 major global companies, 
critically assessing the extent to which they demonstrate 
corporate climate leadership. We evaluate the integrity of 
climate pledges against good practice criteria to identify 
examples for replication and highlight areas where 
improvement is needed. 

Section A of this report includes references to different 
company sample sizes:

• 20 companies: The 2024 CCRM includes in-depth analyses 
of 20 companies across four focus sectors: automotive
manufacturers, electric utilities, fashion, and food and
agriculture (Section B).

• 51 companies: For our aggregated analysis in Section A,
we have also updated our assessments of the 2030 and
net-zero targets for all other 31 companies covered in the
2022 and 2023 iterations of the CCRM. The 51 companies
reported combined revenues of USD 6.1 trillion in 2022.
Their total self-reported GHG emission footprint in 2022,
including upstream and downstream emissions (scope 3)
that may include a marginal degree of overlap, amounts to
approximately 8.8 GtCO2e. This is equivalent to roughly 16%
of global GHG emissions in 2022.

• 28 companies: 28 of the 51 companies analysed in detail
by the 2022, 2023 and 2024 iterations of the CCRM
are covered by the four focus sectors of this report:
automotive manufacturers, electric utilities, fashion,
and food and agriculture. The 28 companies from these
four sectors are sometimes considered in more detail in
Section A of this report.

The first iteration of the CCRM, published in February 2022, 
exposed the ambiguity and insufficiency of corporate climate 
strategies. The report found that major companies’ net-zero 
targets were mostly ambiguous and lacked commitments to 
reducing emissions. The collective ambition of companies to 
reduce emissions by 2030 fell far short of the requirements 
to be aligned with 1.5°C compatible pathways. 

Since 2022, we have seen several significant developments 
aimed at improving the system, including the published 
recommendations of the UN High-Level Expert Group (HLEG), 
updates to International Organization for Standardization’s 
(ISO) standards, introduction of new Science Based Targets 
initiative’s (SBTi) standards, implementation of new 
regulations in some jurisdictions, and the emergence of 
innovative good practices for certain areas. Amid these 
developments, the 2024 CCRM examines what has changed 
in the quality of companies’ climate strategies, what examples 
of leadership are emerging and which sticking points persist.

Companies’ climate 
targets are gradually 

improving yet still  
mostly insufficient  

and unsubstantiated,  
amid a looming threat  

of backsliding.

Key insights
The collective ambition of companies’ 2030 and net-zero climate targets has gradually improved over the last two years.  
However, most companies continue to fall short of the economy-wide emission reductions required to limit global warming to below 1.5°C. (Section 1.1)

The 2030 climate targets of 51 major companies translate to 
a median absolute emission reduction commitment of just 
30% of the full value chain emissions between 2019 and 
2030. This may increase to 33% under the most optimistic 
scenario that emission intensity targets translate to equivalent 
absolute emission reductions (see Figure S1). This represents 
modest progress in companies’ mitigation ambition towards 
2030, with 19 out of 51 companies having made updates 
of varying significance to their 2030 climate pledges over 
the last two years.

An increasing number of companies also substantiate 
their long-term net-zero targets in line with guidance from 
HLEG, ISO and SBTi. More than half of the major 
companies we have assessed (29 out of 51) explicitly 
commit to emission reduction targets alongside their net-
zero pledges. Of these 29 companies, 18 commit to deep 
decarbonisation along their value chain by aiming for close 
to a 90% reduction, partially aligning with 1.5°C-compatible 
decarbonisation milestones.

While this represents tangible progress compared to the 
widespread ambiguity of corporate net-zero targets that 
we identified in the 2022 CCRM, companies’ targets are 
collectively still critically insufficient to be aligned with a 
1.5°C pathway. The average commitment to 30% emission 
reductions by 2030 falls short of the need to decrease global 
GHG and CO2 emissions by around 43% and 48% respectively 
between 2019 and 2030 (IPCC, 2022). Most companies 
continue to present 2030 and net-zero targets that are either 
ambiguous or only commit to limited emission reductions. 
Often, targets cannot be taken at face value as companies 
leave out certain emission sources, use non-harmonised base 
years, do not report updated base year emissions, or do not 
provide contextualising information to understand what the 
targets mean in absolute terms, among other issues. Note: The data in this chart represents the authors' interpretation of companies' emission reduction commitments, based on publicly available information. Targets that are reliant on 

offsets to an undefined extent are marked as ambiguous. See Section B and Annex III for further details and explanations on individual company cases. The median calculation that 
includes emission intensity targets represents the most optimistic scenario that emission intensity targets result in equaivalent absolute emission reductions. 

The colour of the data points represents our assessment of the integrity of company's 2030 targets, based on their sufficiency compared to sector-specific 1.5 °C aligned benchmarks, 
and the appropriateness of the terminology used in the pledge communication.

Proposals for introducing flexibility mechanisms for scope 3 emission reduction targets are gaining momentum, although this would entail backsliding on 
already insufficient commitments, in many cases nullifying companies’ current targets.  (Section 1.2)

Flexibility to offset scope 3 emissions is not the right solution 
to address the challenges that companies understandably 
face in implementing targets for emissions that are partly 
beyond their direct control. Instead, the GHG Protocol 
and SBTi Net Zero Standard revision processes throughout 
2024 are an opportunity to reconsider the categorisation 
of value chain emissions to focus on the most critical 
decarbonisation indicators for each sector which are well 
within companies’ direct control.

Part of the rationale for scope 3 flexibility proposals is to 
increase the flow of voluntary climate finance to climate 
change mitigation projects worldwide through carbon 
crediting, but climate contributions (also referred to as Beyond 
Value Chain Mitigation) can also increase the flow of voluntary 
climate finance without compromising transparency and the 
requirement to decarbonise a company’s own emissions.

In contradiction to the key recommendations of the Integrity 
Matters report by HLEG, which calls for no offsetting towards 
the achievement of interim targets (UN HLEG, 2022), the 
Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative’s (VCMI) beta 
Scope 3 Flexibility Claim would allow companies to purchase 
carbon credits for up to 50% of their annual scope 3 emissions 
to “bridge the gap” to the scope 3 target trajectory that they are 
not on track to meet up to 2030  (VCMI, 2023b). The VCMI’s 
beta claim offers a 50% flexibility threshold compared to a 
company’s actual emissions in any given year. In other words, 
companies can still be eligible if their emissions are double 
the levels that would be implied by the target trajectory in 
any given year. Of the 14 companies for which we could test 
the implications of such a flexibility mechanism, 11 would 
be entitled to the flexibility to even increase (8) or plateau (3) 
their scope 3 emissions between 2019 and 2030, rendering 
these targets as effectively meaningless. Figure S2 shows that 
this proposed flexibility mechanism would nullify the scope 3 
commitments of most companies and leave them accountable 
only to their scope 1 and 2 targets.

Any potential link between the VCMI Scope 3 Flexibility 
Claim and the SBTi target setting guidance remains unclear. 
At COP28 in December 2023, SBTi joined with VCMI and 
other initiatives to announce a “framework for end-to-end 
integrity” aimed at aligning and complementing their guidance, 
and SBTi is currently in the process of evaluating evidence 
on the effectiveness of environmental attribute certificates 
(Manuell, 2023). It remains unclear whether SBTi’s position on 
the use of offsetting towards scope 3 targets could change, 
and whether the VCMI Scope 3 Flexibility Claim could serve 
as a basis for any such changes. This would further weaken 
companies’ SBTi scope 3 targets, which in many cases are 
already insufficient to align with 1.5°C pathways.

reducing their 2030 commitments to cover only scope 1 and 2 emissions

Note: Data includes 14 companies, including all companies from the CCRM 2024 sample with SBTi validations and targets that can be broken down to specific scopes. The 14  companies 
in this figure are only used as examples; we are not aware and do not intend to imply that these companies have indicated an intention to make use of the Scope 3 Flexibility Claim. The 
data points in this chart represents the authors' interpretation of companies' emission reduction commitments, based on publicly available information. The data points include the following 
optimistic assumptions: (1) Emission intensity targets are assumed to result in equivalent absolute emission reductions (2) Although most of the companies would be entitled under the 
VCMI proposal to increase their emissions, the data points show the scenario under which scope 3 emissions remain constant, rather than assuming that they will indeed increase.

The colour of the data points represents our assessment of the integrity of company's 2030 targets, based on their sufficiency compared to sector-specific 1.5 °C aligned benchmarks, 
and the appropriateness of the terminology used in the pledge communication.

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), as the largest and most influential validator of corporate 
targets and independent assessments, plays a critical role in validating corporate climate pledges. A 
comparison between the ratings of SBTi and other assessors indicates a significant degree of leniency 
in the current validation practices and points to multiple areas for improvements.  (Section 1.3)

Founded in 2015, the SBTi has developed into the largest 
and most influential validator of corporate climate targets for 
2030 and beyond. Of the 28 companies covered in the four 
key focus sectors of this analysis, SBTi has validated the 2030 
targets of 22 of these companies to be aligned with a pathway 
to limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C, ‘well-below 
2°C’, or 2°C. Most of these companies prominently highlight 
their SBTi validations in their climate-related communications 
to promote targets that are in many cases insufficient in the 
context of the latest available science.

The comparison between SBTi’s validations of 2030 targets 
and assessments by the CCRM, the Transition Pathways 
Initiative (TPI), the MSCI Net-Zero Tracker, and the Planet 
Tracker, indicates that SBTi could implement the following 
improvements to substantiate and uphold the integrity of 
their validations:  

	� Increase the frequency of the validation cycle for 2030 
corporate climate targets to align validations with the 
latest developments in validation methods and the latest 
scientific findings.

	� Revise approach and develop methodologies to cover scope 
3 emissions related to key relevant emission sources along 
the value chain in SBTi’s target classifications.

	� Remove outdated validations that date back multiple years 
since their issuance or are based on indefinitely paused 
methodologies such as for intensity targets for light-duty 
vehicles in the automotive sector.

	� Refine the SBTi’s Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) 
guidance to specify minimum requirements for the 
reduction of agricultural emissions, or additional targets 
for specific agricultural emission sources, alongside carbon 
dioxide removals.

	� Transparently disclose underlying data and methods for 
each validation and communicate existing limitations 
affecting current validations. 

The SBTi might face multiple challenges to implement 
such timely improvements. As a voluntary initiative mostly 
funded by third parties, the SBTi depends on the voluntary 
participation of companies and needs to accommodate the 
perspectives of different stakeholders when developing its 
validation methodologies. These contextual conditions may 
explain some of the existing flexibility in the system and might 
present a bottleneck for SBTi to further develop towards fully 
science-aligned validations that provide the necessary insights 
for investors, regulators, courts, and other stakeholders on 
1.5°C-aligned climate action. 

Mixed progress towards critical sector 
transitions calls into question the credibility of 
companies’ apparent ambition.  (Section 2.1)

Only four companies’ emission reduction plans embody the 
necessary shift from pledges to actual implementation. For 
instance, Danone commits to significantly reduce methane 
emissions from fresh milk until 2030 and to increase the share 
of plant-based products. Enel and Iberdrola have increased the 
installed capacity of renewables, especially solar and wind, and 
plan to further ramp this up in the near future. Volvo Group 
invests in zero-emission vehicles, charging infrastructure and 
low-carbon steel and aluminium.

Whereas we see some promising examples among the 
automotive manufacturers, electric utilities and food and 
agriculture companies, none of the five fashion companies 
present convincing emission reduction plans, raising concerns 
about the feasibility of the companies’ ambitious 2030 
targets. The fashion companies implement measures to 
increase renewable electricity use in the supply chain, but 
also encourage suppliers to switch to biomass or natural gas, 
which are not credible decarbonisation options. None of the 
five companies commit to reducing overproduction or moving 
away from the fast fashion business model.

7Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



	r CCUS and ‘transitional fuels’ as an alternative to fossil 
fuel phase-out (Section 3.1)

Despite being one of the main levers to reduce emissions in the 
power, automotive, and fashion sectors, only a minority of the 
companies assessed in our analysis commit to a fossil fuel phase-
out. A phase-out of coal and fossil gas is particularly crucial in the 
energy sector, as this is a prerequisite for the decarbonisation 
of other high-emitting sectors through electrification. Most 
electric utilities assessed in our analysis address the need 
to exit coal, but fossil gas is still seen as a ‘transitional fuel’, 
especially outside Europe. The automotive sector is lagging in 
phasing out internal combustion engines. The fashion sector has 
started to reduce coal from its production processes, but a full 
commitment is yet to be made. Overall, we find that companies' 
commitments to phase out fossil fuels depend largely on the 
regulatory environment at the national and regional level, as the 
phase-in of alternatives must take place in parallel and requires 
dedicated incentive schemes. 

We recommend that regulators, standard setters, 
and voluntary initiatives formulate more prescriptive 
guidelines on the necessity for companies to include fossil 
fuel phase-out requirements in their transition plans.

	r Standalone Renewable Energy Certificates (Section 3.2)

Companies are increasingly reporting renewable electricity 
targets and higher shares of renewable electricity consumption, 
but these targets and claims all mean different things and 
their real impact is often far less than implied. Standalone 
RECs still play a large role in companies’ renewable electricity 
procurement strategies, but companies demonstrate increasing 
awareness on the limitations of this approach and many plan 
to shift towards higher-quality procurement instruments 
including Power Purchase Agreements. Momentum is also 
building for hourly matching of renewable electricity, but 
support and incentives are needed for more companies to 
adopt this approach. We find that voluntary initiatives and 
standards currently provide limited incentives for companies 
to strive for higher-quality renewable electricity strategies. The 
update process for the GHG Protocol’s guidance on Scope 2 
emissions accounting is a promising opportunity to realign the 
standard with transparent and ambitious practices. 

We recommend revising the market-based emission 
accounting method to better differentiate between the 
highly significant nuances in renewable electricity strategies.

	r Bioenergy (Section 3.3)

While over half of the companies assessed consider bioenergy 
in their decarbonisation plans, bioenergy is not a credible 
solution for any of them. Particularly in the fashion sector, 
plans for switching coal to biomass in the supply chain 
may significantly undermine seemingly ambitious emission 
reduction targets – and in some cases render them meaningless. 
Contrary to popular belief, bioenergy is not an emissions-free 
energy source, and sourcing biomass is likely to have negative 
impacts on ecosystems and local communities. Companies 
that consider themselves climate leaders should refrain from 
using bioenergy and advocate for policy changes in regions 
where sourcing bioenergy is easier and cheaper than sourcing 
non-combustible sources of renewable energy. 

We recommend that accounting guidance is revised to 
recognise that bioenergy is not an equal alternative to 
non-combustible renewables.

Many companies continue to rely on false solutions such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) standalone Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), 
bioenergy and carbon dioxide removals as an alternative to emission reductions.  (Sections 2 and 3)

We identify over-reliance on the following contentious solutions and recommendations to mitigate them:

8Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



	r Carbon dioxide removals and ‘insetting’ (Section 3.4)

Carbon dioxide removals are crucial to reach net-zero 
emissions globally by mid-century. However, companies in 
the food and agriculture sector are currently counting on land 
sequestration carbon dioxide removals within their value chain 
to meet significant portions of their emission reduction targets, 
sometimes referred to as ‘insetting’. Besides major uncertainties 
around the permanence and potential of land sequestration 
CDR, the aggregation of removals and emission reductions 
is hiding a lack of commitment and progress towards the 
necessary agricultural transitions for reducing emissions from 
highly challenging sources, such as methane emissions from 
livestock and nitrous oxide emissions from fertiliser application.

We recommend refining the SBTi’s FLAG guidance to specify 
minimum requirements for the reduction of agricultural 
emissions or additional targets for specific agricultural 
emission sources, alongside carbon dioxide removals. 

	r Neutralising residual emissions (Section 3.5)

Companies’ reliance on carbon dioxide removals to fulfil their 
net-zero targets is high, at times reaching up to 50% of their 
2019 emissions. Their plans appear to be unrealistic because 
they rely on excessive volumes of CDR compared to the 
definition of residual emissions implied by 1.5°C-aligned 
sector-specific pathways. Furthermore, they mostly rely 
on land sequestration CDR with a high probability of non-
permanence. It is also highly unlikely that the scarce supply 
of high-quality CDR can match the high demand for CDR. 
This over-reliance has the potential to jeopardise global net 
zero, if companies use removals to delay emissions reductions. 

We recommend that regulators and corporate guidelines 
require companies to set three separate targets for 
emission reductions, land sequestration removals, and 
technical removals without neutralisation claims.

Companies appear to be moving away from misleading carbon neutrality claims. 

Several companies, including Nestlé, Danone, Nike, Stellantis 
and Volvo Group, appear to have moved away from some of 
the unsubstantiated carbon neutrality claims that they used to 
make in the past, thereby improving the transparency of their 
climate communications. Danone continues to make modest 
contributions to climate change mitigation beyond its value 
chain despite moving away from making carbon neutrality 
claims for its brands (although the company continue to make 
carbon neutrality claims for its production sites; see below). 
Google and Microsoft – both of which received a poor rating 
for the integrity of their carbon neutrality claims in the 2023 
Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor – also appear to be 
quietly moving away from these claims, even though both 
companies still appear to procure carbon credits equivalent 
to their scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Among the 20 companies assessed, only four — Daimler Truck, 
Danone, Mars, and Volkswagen Group — reported in 2022 or 

2023 that certain products or aspects of their businesses were 
carbon neutral, using carbon credits. We have rated all these 
claims to be of very poor or unclear integrity: each claim applies 
to only a fraction of the respective company’s emissions, and 
none of the companies provide evidence that the carbon credits 
they procure are of sufficiently high quality to be considered 
equivalent to reducing the company’s own emissions.

In 2024, the EU adopted a ban on climate-neutral advertising 
on products and services (European Parliament, 2024). This 
breakthrough legislation marks the first time in the world 
where policymakers have banned carbon neutrality claims, 
potentially setting a precedent for similar developments in 
other countries. During 2023, a wave of European business 
consultancies and carbon credit sellers – including myclimate, 
ClimatePartner and South Pole – also announced a transition 
away from carbon neutrality labels.

A climate contribution refers to finance provided by a company to 
support climate change action beyond the company’s own value 
chain, without claiming to neutralise its own emissions. Climate 
contributions can also increase the flow of voluntary climate 
finance without compromising transparency and the requirement 
to decarbonise a company’s own emissions. Despite this, only a 
small number of the companies in this report are contributing 
to climate change mitigation beyond their value chains without 
claiming neutralisation of emissions, and the volumes of support 
from these companies remain modest.

Several developments in 2023 and 2024 have contributed 
to moving the climate contribution model from a theoretical 
concept towards an implementation-ready model. However, 
undefined details that require further elaboration will determine 
the extent to which these developments represent a significant 
step forward or merely a repackaging of old approaches.

•	 In February 2024, SBTi published the outcome of its 
consultation process on recommendations for companies 
to engage in beyond value chain mitigation (BVCM) 
(Benson et al., 2024). The outcome is an operationalisation 
of the climate contribution approach; companies are 
recommended to provide finance — based on a carbon price 
applied to the volume of their own emission footprint — to 
climate change mitigation efforts outside of the companies’ 
value chain. However, the SBTi report does not rule out the 
possibility of companies making compensation claims under 
the BVCM approach, which is a highly relevant omission. 
If a decision is made to depart from the core principles 
of SBTi to allow offsetting toward target fulfilment, then 
the BVCM recommendations could have a substantially 
different meaning compared to the current situation.

•	 The Gold Standard also published a “Step by step guidance 
for organisations taking responsibility for their unabated 
emissions” (Gold Standard, 2024), which aligns with SBTi’s 
best practice recommendations on BVCM and is also 
prescriptive on claims.

•	 The Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity initiative’s (VCMI) 
“carbon integrity” claims guidance also constitutes a form 
of climate contribution approach: although exclusively 
based on carbon credit procurement, companies are 
recommended not to claim the neutralisation of their 
emissions through this means (VCMI, 2023a). Despite 
this potentially positive development, it remains to be seen 
whether the VCMI carbon integrity claims will be picked up 
by companies, compared to VCMI’s other separate proposed 
framework: the VCMI’s beta Scope 3 Flexibility Claim would 
allow companies to offset emissions towards their scope 3 
targets, posing a major risk to corporate ambition.

In 2024, details on claim terminology and finance recipients 
need to be clarified. Most importantly, the potential links 
between these frameworks and any emerging flexibility 
mechanisms need to be clarified. The claims that companies 
can make with the contributions that they provide should 
be specified in clear terms to avoid a new generation of 
inconsistent and potentially misleading communications. 
More guidance is needed regarding where and how climate 
contributions could be channelled. With these details, business 
consultancies and project developers will be able to follow 
a clear framework, and more companies will be able to start 
using this model.

The publication of guidelines in 2023 and 2024 constitute concrete steps towards operationalising 
and mainstreaming climate contributions, but there remains a lack of specificity on the claims that 
companies can and cannot make based on the contributions they provide. (Section 4.1)

The integrity of the current corporate 
accountability system is impaired by inherent 
tensions deriving from a lack of institutional 
separation and direct corporate influence. We 
need to evolve from voluntary initiatives to 
formal accountability. (Section 4.3)

The findings of our analysis show that – while voluntary 
initiatives play a key role in the corporate climate accountability 
system – the current over-reliance on voluntary initiatives for 
many functions of the system does not result in sufficiently 
credible corporate climate action, despite the increasing urgency 
of the climate crisis. These pioneering initiatives were formed 
at a time when corporate climate action was in its early stages. 
As we have now reached a stage where most of the largest and 
most influential multinational corporates regularly announce 
targets and strategies to reduce emissions, the model of 
voluntary mobilisation may have outgrown its original purpose.

Prompt adjustments to the existing system are needed 
to establish institutional separation and independence 
between actors performing the functions of standard setting, 
validations, and mobilisation.

	� Institutional separation for key functions of the 
accountability system avoids some of the most basic 
tensions that impair the integrity of the current system. 
Mobilisation and capacity-building initiatives should be 
able to engage as many companies as possible, while those 
setting science-aligned standards should not compromise 
between companies’ interests on the one side and scientific 
findings on the other side.

	� Compliance, grievance, and whistle blowing mechanisms 
must be introduced within existing voluntary initiatives 
to accompany this institutional separation.

10Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



In parallel to these adjustments of the existing system, the 
corporate climate accountability system should start to shift 
from voluntary initiatives to formal accountability including 
regulation, accredited verification and validation entities, and 
effective advocacy and litigation.

Assessments were made based on public information identified by the authors. A poor rating may not necessarily be an indication that a company’s climate strategy is 
weak, but could also indicate that the information was insufficient to confirm good practice. Ambitious companies can improve their ratings by ensuring that all aspects 
of their climate responsibility strategies are transparently and accurately disclosed, and in the public domain.

	� The legally binding nature of regulation contributes to an enforceable accountability system in which it is no longer voluntary 
for companies to commit to corporate climate strategies, and in which companies and auditors can be held accountable.

	� The introduction of regulation or international standards will enable target validations and performance verifications by 
accredited and legally liable entities. Like traditional financial auditing by accounting firms, entities performing validations and 
verifications could undergo accreditations by regulators and can be held legally liable in case of negligence. This formalisation 
can enhance the effectiveness of the advocacy and litigation activities. 

	� This necessary shift includes an important role for voluntary initiatives to scrutinise forthcoming regulations and promote 
upward convergence to high-ambition standards.

About the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor
The need for scrutiny on corporate climate action

Many companies are putting themselves at the forefront of 
climate action. Corporate climate pledge setting is becoming 
standard practice: by February 2024, over 10,000 companies 
had joined the UNFCCC’s Race to Zero campaign (UNFCCC, 
2023b), including many of the world’s largest companies.

The increasing concern within civil society about the climate 
crisis is leading to increased pressure from consumers, 
shareholders, and regulators for companies to decarbonise. 
In parallel, companies realise that the trajectory towards 
decarbonising the global economy is firmly established, and it 
is increasingly attractive for them to assume a leading role in 
that new paradigm. Many companies are scrambling to adopt 
new approaches and narratives to demonstrate their climate 
leadership. However, the rapid acceleration of corporate 
climate pledge setting, combined with the fragmentation of 
approaches and the general lack of regulation or oversight, 
makes it challenging to distinguish real climate leadership 
from unsubstantiated greenwashing.

The criteria for good practice climate action by companies 
has shifted with the increasingly clear scientific evidence 
that underpins the urgency of the climate crisis. With the 
objectives of the Paris Agreement, greenhouse gas emissions 
need to be reduced at speed across all countries and sectors. 
To meet the 1.5°C limit, global greenhouse gases and CO2 
emissions must be reduced by 43% and 48%, respectively, 
from 2019 levels by 2030. This trajectory aims to  reach 
net-zero global CO2 emissions by around 2050, followed by 
net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by around 2070 
and net-negative emissions thereafter (IPCC, 2022). 

Company actions that were considered viable only five years 
ago are often far from sufficient according to the current 
state of knowledge. For example, it is no longer sufficient 
for companies to only address their own direct emissions; 
rather, companies need to address upstream and downstream 
emissions as well. It is no longer good practice for a company to 

offset emissions by reducing or removing emissions elsewhere; 
rather, emission reductions and removals ‘elsewhere’ need to 
be enhanced in parallel to the company’s emission reductions. 

The challenge of distinguishing real climate leadership 
from greenwashing is significant, but addressing it has the 
potential to unlock more substantial global climate change 
mitigation efforts. Corporate climate action is key to closing 
the emissions gap to align with a 1.5°C pathway. In a short 
space of time and in the absence of sufficient top-down 
regulation, consumers’ and shareholders’ expectations have 
become a major driver for enhanced corporate climate action. 
Companies appear to be responding to these expectations. 
To support this important bottom-up pressure, it is essential 
that the credibility of companies’ strategies is transparent and 
can be understood by their target audiences.

The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor
The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor evaluates the 
transparency and integrity of companies’ climate pledges with 
the following objectives:

	� Identify and highlight good practice approaches that can 
be replicated by others, recognising that companies are 
experimenting to work out what constructive and credible 
practices are.

	� Evaluate the transparency and integrity of major 
companies’ climate leadership claims and provide a 
structured methodology for others to replicate such an 
evaluation. Transparency refers to the extent to which 
a company publicly discloses the information necessary 
to fully understand the integrity of that company’s 

approaches towards the various elements of corporate 
climate responsibility. Integrity, in this context, is a 
measure of the quality, credibility, and comprehensiveness 
of those approaches. 

	� Highlight opportunities for enhancing the corporate 
climate accountability system based on emerging good 
practices and issues that we observe.

The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor focuses on four 
main areas of corporate climate action: tracking and disclosure 
of emissions (methodology section 1), setting emission reduction 
targets (methodology section 2), reducing own emissions 
(methodology section 3) and taking responsibility for unabated 
and residual emissions (methodology section 4). Evaluations 

for 20 major global companies are set out in Section B of this 
report. Section A analyses aggregate trends drawing on up to 51 
detailed company assessments, which includes the companies 
assessed in section B of this report, as well as those covered in 
the 2022 and 2023 iterations of the CCRM.

The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor is prepared by 
NewClimate Institute, with support from Carbon Market 
Watch. The consortium partners combine years of experience 
with the independent critical analysis of corporate climate 
action and carbon market mechanisms. NewClimate 
Institute and Carbon Market Watch are both not-for-profit 
organisations. Neither institution holds private commercial 
interests in voluntary carbon credit markets.

12Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Development of the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor
The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor follows the guiding 
principles for good practice corporate climate responsibility 
outlined in the accompanying methodology document: 
Guidance and assessment criteria for good practice corporate 
emission reduction and net-zero targets: Version 4.0 (NewClimate 
Institute, 2023a) We have drawn these guiding principles from 
a combination of scientific literature review, previous work by 
the authors, and the identification of existing good practices 
from company case studies. These guiding principles address 
issues where the state of scientific knowledge and debate are 
rapidly evolving. The views expressed in this document reflect 
the perspectives of the authors, based on our interpretation 
of existing research and current developments. While these 
views may not be universally held,  we note that version 4.0 
of the methodology in 2024 is very closely aligned with the 
converging guidance of other major initiatives including the 

UN High Level Expert Group on Net Zero Targets and the ISO 
Net Zero Guidelines on net zero targets (see Table 2).

The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor promotes 
transparency with the philosophy that consumers, 
shareholders, regulators, and CSOs should be able to follow 
and assess the integrity of companies’ claims. Accordingly, the 
company assessments in section B are solely based on publicly 
available information that the authors were able to identify (see 
Annex-Data Sources in the Methodology document). Each rating 
represents the authors’ understanding of the publicly available 
information. In some cases, company information was scattered 
across different sources (e.g., annual reports, press releases 
and statements, webpages, or other marketing materials); it 
is possible in this process that information may have been 
misinterpreted, or that relevant information was overlooked. 

Companies should consider how to present information as 
transparently as possible to ensure that observers are able 
to access all relevant information necessary to understand 
their climate strategies.

We assess companies primarily based on self-reported 
information. We do not verify or certify the accuracy of the 
information provided by companies, including their GHG 
emission reporting. In specific cases, we supplement the self-
reported information with data from other sources, but we 
cannot guarantee the accuracy of that information.

Climate Responsibility Monitor. Guidance and assessment 
criteria for good practice corporate emission reduction and net-
zero targets: Version 4.0 (NewClimate Institute, 2024).
 

Good practice overview
Corporates looking to take a position of climate leadership can learn from each other to replicate good practice approaches that 
are transparent, constructive and robust. The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024 assesses 20 major global companies 
to identify good practices in four key areas.

•	 Tracking and disclosure of emissions: To develop a comprehensive and robust climate strategy, it is key that companies 
understand and are transparent about their GHG emission footprints and their trajectories.

•	 Setting specific and substantiated targets: Companies’ headline climate change pledges encompass a broad range of target 
setting approaches. Regardless of the type of target and the terminology used, the commitments should send a clear signal 
for immediate action to decarbonise the value chain and avoid misleading consumers, shareholders, observers and regulators. 

•	 Reducing emissions: Encompassing measures for deep emission reductions is the backbone of ambitious corporate climate targets.

•	 Responsibility for unabated and residual emissions: Corporate climate leadership extends beyond ambitious target setting 
to include taking responsibility for unabated emissions and avoiding misleading offsetting claims.

Figure 1 provides an overview of good practice corporate 
climate responsibility and our rating methodology for each 
of these four areas. Table 2 demonstrates the alignment of 
this methodology with our major standards and initiatives. 

Our assessments include a rating of the transparency and 
integrity of companies’ approaches. Transparency refers 
to the extent to which a company publicly discloses the 
information necessary to fully understand the integrity of its 
approaches towards the various elements of corporate climate 
responsibility. Integrity, in this context, measures the quality, 
credibility and comprehensiveness of those approaches. 

Full details on our methodology for assessing good practice 
across these four areas can be found in the accompanying 
methodological document: Guidance and assessment criteria for 
good practice corporate emission reduction and net-zero targets: 
Version 4.0 (NewClimate Institute, 2024).

of USD 6.1 trillion in 2022. Their total self-reported GHG emission footprint in 2022, 
including upstream and downstream emissions (scope 3) that may include a marginal 
degree of overlap, amounts to approximately 8.8 GtCO2e. This is equivalent to roughly 
16% of global GHG emissions in 2022.

•	 28 companies: 28 of the 51 companies analysed in detail by the 2022, 2023 and 2024

Net-zero and 2030 targets: integrity over flexibility 
in the crucial decade of climate action  

Summary 

The 2030 climate pledges of 51 of the largest multinational 
companies show some gradual improvements over the last 
two years. We estimate the median 2030 emission reduction 
commitment of these 51 companies to be 30–33% below 2019 
levels. This gradual improvement in 2030 targets coincides with 
an emerging consensus across recently published voluntary 
standards on the meaning of credible longer-term corporate 
net-zero targets. Against this backdrop, an increasing 
number of companies substantiate their net-zero targets by 
explicitly committing to deep decarbonisation along their 
value chains, in line with 1.5°C-compatible emission 
reduction pathways for their respective sectors.

Despite these gradual improvements, the collective 2030 
ambition continues to fall short of the economy-wide emission 
reductions required to stay below the 1.5°C temperature limit. 
While some companies set partially 1.5°C-aligned 2030 targets 
and measures to achieve them, many others either lack credible 
measures or set inadequate and outdated 2030 targets in the 
first place. The voluntary nature of existing standards on net-
zero targets further allows almost half of the 51 companies 
to continue remaining vague about what exactly they intend 
to achieve as part of these pledges.   

The world enters the fourth year of the crucial decade for climate action towards 2030 with a rapidly closing window to correct 
the course on what is required to limit global warming to 1.5°C. To stand a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to 
1.5°C, global GHG and CO2 emissions must decrease by around 43% and 48% respectively between 2019 and 2030, and by 
84% and 99% by 2050 (IPCC, 2022).

Against the backdrop of recent scientific findings, the collective ambition of companies’ 2030 climate 
pledges has gradually improved over the last two years. However, most companies continue to fall far 
short of the economy-wide emission reductions required to stay below the 1.5°C temperature limit until 
the end of the decade.

The 2030 targets of 51 major companies covered in our CCRM analyses between 2022 to 2024 translate to a median absolute 
emission reduction commitment of just 30% of the full value chain emissions between 2019 and 2030.1 This may increase to 
33% under the most optimistic scenario that emission intensity targets translate to equivalent absolute emission reductions 
(see Figure 2). This represents modest progress in companies’ mitigation ambition towards 2030, with 19 out of 51 companies 
having updated their 2030 climate pledges over the last two years to varying degrees.2

Corporate targets for 2030, however, remain subject to a high level of uncertainty on what they mean in practice. Targets often 
cannot be taken at face value as companies, among other issues, may omit certain emission sources, use non-harmonised base 
years, fail to report updated base year emissions, or provide insufficient contextual information to understand what the targets 
mean in absolute terms.

1     The CCRM 24 includes in-depth analyses of 20 companies (see Section B). We have updated all 2030 and net-zero targets for all other 31 companies included 
in the CCRM 22 and 23 as of April 2024 (see Annex I).

2    We identify updates 2030 targets for Accenture, BMW, Carrefour, Danone, Enel, ENGIE, Iberdrola, IKEA, Inditex, KEPCO, Maersk, Mars, Mercedes-Benz, 
Novartis, Tesco, Toyota, Unilever., Vodafone, and Volvo Group as of April 2024 (in alphabetical order).

Figure 2: The median commitment to emission reductions between 2019 and 2030 is 30-33%
This chart shows the proportion of full value chain GHG emissions that companies commit to reduce between 2019 and 2030. 
Data includes 51 companies. 4 companies without clear commitments for 2030 are not included.

Note: The data in this chart represents the authors' interpretation of companies' emission reduction commitments, based on publicly available information. Targets that are reliant on 
offsets to an undefined extent are marked as ambiguous. See Section B and Annex III for further details and explanations on individual company cases. The median calculation that 
includes emission intensity targets represents the most optimistic scenario that emission intensity targets result in equaivalent absolute emission reductions. 

The colour of the data points represents our assessment of the integrity of company's 2030 targets, based on their sufficiency compared to sector-specific 1.5 °C aligned benchmarks, 
and the appropriateness of the terminology used in the pledge communication.

Several companies across different economic 
sectors take a leading role in setting updated and 
partially science-aligned targets towards 2030. 
However, companies need to substantiate these 
targets with transparent and credible plans to 
achieve them by the end of this decade. 

In the four focus sectors of this analysis — fashion, automotive 
manufacturers, food and agriculture, and electric utilities — 
eight of the 28 companies assessed have set 2030 targets that 
we rate as having high or reasonable integrity. These targets at 
least partially meet 1.5°C-aligned decarbonisation milestones 
for the major emission sources within specific sectors.

Among these companies, we observe variation in the degree 
to which companies substantiate these ambitious 2030 targets 
with relevant emission reduction measures (see Table 3). Only 
four of the eight companies whose 2030 targets have high 
or reasonable integrity have emission reduction plans that 
may support the necessary shift from pledges to actual 
implementation: Danone, Iberdrola, Mars and Volvo Group 
(see Section 2.1 for analysis on the mixed progress towards critical 
sector transitions). These companies’ targets in combination 
with their underlying transition plans for 2030 reflect the 
latest developments in technology, voluntary and regulative 
frameworks, and scientific findings to stay below the 1.5°C 
temperature limit. For some other companies, in particular 
fashion companies like H&M Group, Nike and Inditex, we 
identify a significant gap between their ambitious targets and 
the lack of underlying measures to support them.

Despite some promising developments, many companies’ 2030 climate pledges 
are outdated and remain inadequate. These targets often cover only selected 
emission scopes and have not been substantially updated for five years or more.

Despite promising developments on updated 2030 targets by leading companies, many other 
companies’ mitigation ambition towards 2030 remains inadequate. Some of these targets were 
initially set more than five years ago. For example, Walmart set its 2030 targets in 2016 and 
2017 and has not significantly updated them since. As a result, these targets are outdated and 
do not reflect latest developments in science, technology, and validation methods.

Against this backdrop, many of these 2030 targets fail to meet key recommendations for 2030 
target setting that have been published as voluntary guidance over the last two years. For 
example, 2030 targets remain predominantly focused on operational scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
while only inadequately addressing their full up- and downstream scope 3 emissions that are 
essential to successfully transition their business model (see Section 1.2 for further analysis on 
scope 3 targets). The UN HLEG recommendations and ISO Net Zero Guidelines both emphasise 
the need for 2030 targets to cover all emission scopes and address key relevant emission sources 
along their value chain (ISO, 2022, pp. 19–20; UN , 2022, p. 17). 

Some companies even backpedal on their previously announced commitments instead of 
updating them in line with recent guidance. For example, Volkswagen entirely dropped its 2025 
target between the reporting periods of 2021 and 2022 without any announced replacement. 

The current validation practice of corporate targets by voluntary initiatives allows companies to 
keep promoting outdated targets. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), as the largest and 
most influential validator of corporate targets, currently allows validations of 2030 targets to 
be used indefinitely. From 2025 onwards, companies will “be required to review, and if necessary 
revalidate, their targets every five years from the date of the original target approval” (SBTi, 2024b). 
However, a five-year review period is arguably too long for a ‘science-aligned’ target setting 
process as latest scientific findings on climate action are both fast-developing and indicating 
an urgent need for re-alignment with those new findings. Our analysis across more than 50 
companies suggests that accelerating the revision and validation cycles of corporate climate 
targets — for example biannually to reflect latest developments — could help to overcome 
legacy issues that hinder the acceleration of climate action.

An increasing number of companies substantiate their net-zero and carbon 
neutrality targets in line with recently published voluntary standards and 
guidance.

More than a year has passed since the release of the recommendations by UN Secretary General’s 
High-Level Expert Group (HLEG), the Net Zero Principles by the International Organization 
for Standardization, and the second version of the Science Based Targets initiative’s Net Zero 
Standard (ISO, 2022; UN HLEG, 2022; SBTi, 2023d). Recent analysis finds that these voluntary 
standards, guidance, and assessment frameworks show an emerging consensus on the meaning of 
credible longer-term corporate net-zero targets and some of the specific criteria to operationalise 
them (see Chapter 4 in Net Zero Tracker, 2023). The available guidance thus provides companies 
with specific recommendations on how to pursue longer-term target setting with integrity.

More than half of the major companies we have assessed (29 out of 51) explicitly commit to 
emission reduction targets alongside their net-zero pledges (see Figure 3). Eighteen companies 
commit to deep decarbonisation along their value chain by aiming for close to a 90% reduction, 
partially aligning with 1.5°C-compatible decarbonisation milestones. Some companies have 
explicitly updated their net-zero pledges over the last two years. For example, Inditex clarified 
that its 2040 net-zero target implies a 90% absolute emission reduction across the entire value 
chain below 2018 levels, equivalent to 89% below 2019 levels. Similarly, both Tesco and Mars 
substantiated their net-zero pledges by committing to emission reduction targets alongside 
their net-zero pledges in 2023. 

19Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Figure 3: 18 of 51 companies commit to deep decarbonisation with their net-zero pledges
This chart shows the proportion of full value chain GHG emissions that companies commit to reduce with their net-zero pledges.
Data includes 51 companies. For 18 other companies the meaning of the net-zero target is ambiguous. 

Despite specific recommendations on how to 
set credible net-zero targets, almost half of 
the existing net-zero targets remains of poor 
or unclear integrity due to the inadequacy 
or absence of explicit emission reduction 
commitments, scope exclusions, or ambiguous 
offsetting and neutralisation strategies.

Twenty-two of the 51 companies continue to remain vague 
on what exactly they intend to achieve as part of these net-
zero pledges. Of these 22 companies, three companies at 
least commit to measures that implicitly substantiate their 
pledges by addressing a substantial share of emissions. For 
example, Volvo Group does not set an emission reduction 
target alongside its 2040 net-zero pledge but does commit 
to aspirational sales shares of heavy-duty zero-emission 
vehicles under an illustrative scenario for 1.5°C towards 
2040. The other 19 companies neither explicitly specify 
the extent to which they intend to reduce emissions nor 
commit to other quantitative decarbonisation milestones 
that would imply deep emission reductions. The exclusion 
of relevant emission scopes like for Walmart, Tesco or 
Nestlé or the ambiguity of the role of emission reductions 
compared to offsetting and neutralisation strategies like for 
Volkswagen or Toyota represent key remaining obstacles 
for higher ambition across major companies.

The voluntary nature of current standards and guidance 
continues to leave companies with the flexibility to follow 
recent recommendations by HELG, ISO, or SBTi or simply 
continue with vaguely formulated, unsubstantiated, and 
potentially misleading targets.

Note: The data in this chart represents the authors' interpretation of the authors of companies' emission reduction commitments, based on publicly available information. The chart includes 
emission reduction commitments under net-zero targets, carbon neutrality pledges and other pledges with equivalent terminology, for the respective target year, which ranges between 2030 and 
2050. Targets that are reliant on offsets to an undefined extent are marked as ambiguous. See company case studies in Section B and Annex III for further details on individual company cases.

The colour of the data points represents our assessment of the integrity of company's 2030 targets, based on their sufficiency compared to sector-specific 1.5 °C aligned benchmarks, 
and the appropriateness of the terminology used in the pledge communication.

1.2 Scope 3 emissions: insufficiency and the risk of backsliding

Summary 

The limited depth of emission reduction targets for companies’ 
up- and downstream value chain emissions (scope 3) remain 
a key limitation for the integrity of most companies’ 2030 
climate pledges. These emissions are often the most significant 
and relevant for the sector transformations that would be 
necessary to align with a 1.5°C pathway. Although we see 
signs of gradual improvement in addressing value chain 
emissions by 2030 targets, proposals for introducing flexibility 
mechanisms in the form of offsetting for scope 3 targets are 
gaining momentum. This would entail backsliding on already 
insufficient commitments. The VCMI beta scope 3 flexibility 
claim could effectively nullify the scope 3 targets of most of 
the companies we have analysed for the period up to 2030, 
leaving them accountable only to their scope 1 and 2 emission 
targets. Any potential link between the VCMI scope 3 flexibility 
proposal and the SBTi target setting guidance remains unclear. 
Instead, of addressing the challenges of target implementation 
through offsetting, the GHG Protocol and SBTi Net Zero 
Standard revision processes are an opportunity to reconsider 
the categorisation of value chain emissions to focus on the 
most critical decarbonisation indicators for each sector which 
are well within companies’ direct control.

A key limitation of many companies’ targets for 
2030 is the lack of depth in addressing up- and 
downstream (scope 3) emissions, which account 
for the majority of their footprint and are often 
within the direct control of companies.

Up- and downstream (scope 3) emissions account for over 
90% of the emission footprints of most of the 51 companies 
assessed in the CCRM. Companies’ 2030 targets – and 
voluntary initiatives that validate those targets – primarily 
focus on operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) for the 
period up to 2030. Addressing up- and downstream scope 
3 emissions is essential to successfully transition companies’ 
business models. 

In some sectors, scope 3 emissions are the main emission 
source of relevance regarding the sector transformations that 
would be necessary to align with a 1.5°C pathway, and these 
are emissions that are within the direct control of companies 
because they result directly from business model decisions. 
Sector transformations often depend on the type of product 
that companies choose to produce, rather than how it is 
produced, as demonstrated in Table 4. 

The UN HLEG recommendations and ISO Net Zero Guidelines 
emphasise the need for 2030 targets to cover all emission 
scopes (ISO, 2022, pp. 19–20; UN , 2022, p. 17).

21Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Table 4: Relevance of scope 3 emissions for companied covered in the 2024 CCRM

Proposals for introducing flexibility mechanisms 
for scope 3 targets are gaining momentum, 
although this would entail backsliding on already 
insufficient commitments, in many cases 
nullifying companies’ current targets.

There is a clear consensus within the scientific community that 
companies should not be able to achieve short- and medium-
term emission reduction targets through offsetting. This has 
been a long-standing principle of SBTi since its initiation, and 
was also one of the key recommendations of the Integrity 
Matters report by the United Nations’ High-Level Expert 
Group on the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State 
Entities (UNFCCC, 2023c).

In contradiction to these recommendations, 2024 sees an 
active discussion on the potential role of offsetting towards 
scope 3 targets.

The Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity initiative (VCMI) 
Claims Code of Practice – launched in November 2023 ahead 
of COP28 – is intended to be a demand-side rulebook on how 
companies can make voluntary use of carbon credits as part of 
credible, science-aligned net-zero decarbonisation pathways 
(VCMI, 2023a). VCMI’s guidelines include a framework 
for “carbon integrity” claims, which could be understand 
as a constructive approach to climate change mitigation 
contributions beyond a company’s value chain and targets 
(see section 4.1), as well as a separate framework referred to 
as the VCMI beta scope 3 flexibility claim. 

VCMI’s scope 3 flexibility proposal would allow companies 
to purchase carbon credits for up to 50% of their annual 
scope 3 emissions to “bridge the gap” to the scope 3 target 
trajectory that they are not on track to meet up to 2030 
(VCMI, 2023b). Whether this constitutes offsetting depends 
on one’s interpretation of terminology, but it offers companies 
the possibility to use carbon credits as an alternative, rather 
than a complement, to cutting their own emissions, during 
the “critical decade” for action.

~99%
of emissions derive from scope 3 emissions on average, 
mostly from the use of sold vehicles downstream. The 
companies’ climate footprints are mostly dependent on 
the extent to which companies continue to produce 
internal combustion engine vehicles, or transition to 
manufacturing electric vehicles.

Just ~1% 

of emissions derive from operations (scope 1 
and 2) to produce these vehicles. Installing 
solar panels onto production facilities will not 
transform the emissions footprint of the 
businesses.

~95%
of emissions derive from scope 3 on average, mostly 
from activities such as rearing livestock and the use of 
fertilisers. The companies’ climate footprints are mostly 
dependent on the extent to which companies shift their 
business models to plant-based products.

Just ~5%
of emissions derive from operations (scope 1 
and 2) related to operating offices, warehouses 
and stores. Reducing emissions from operations 
will not transform the emissions footprint of 
the businesses.

~95%
of emissions derive from scope 3 emissions on average, 
mostly from the procurement of materials and the use 
of energy in the supply chain. The companies’ climate 
footprints are mostly dependent on the extent to which 
companies transition to sustainable materials and 
renewable energy within the supply chain.

Just ~5%
of emissions derive from operations (scope 1 
and 2) related to operating offices, warehouses 
and stores. Reducing emissions from operations 
will not transform the emissions footprint of 
the businesses.

~63%
of emissions derive from scope 3 emissions on average, 
mostly from the procurement of electricity for retail and 
the downstream use of sold natural gas. Many major 
companies transition towards a retail business model, 
shifting their emissions from scope 1 to scope 3. Their 
climate footprint is dependent not only on their own 
generation but also the business model they pursue as a 
retailer of fossil or renewable energy.

~37%
of emissions derive from Scope 1 emissions, 
mostly from electricity generation. This 
emission source is highly relevant for many 
electric utilities, when the business model is 
focused more on direct generation than retail.

2023, SBTi collaborated with VCMI and other initiatives to 
announce a “framework for end-to-end integrity” aimed at 
aligning and complementing their guidance (Manuell, 2023). 
It remains unclear whether SBTi’s position on the use of 
offsetting towards scope 3 targets could change, and whether 
the VCMI Scope 3 Flexibility Claim could serve as a basis for 
any such changes. This would further weaken companies’ SBTi 
scope 3 targets, which in many cases are already critically 
insufficient to align with 1.5°C pathways (see section 1.3).

The VCMI’s beta claim sets a 50% flexibility threshold 
compared to a company’s actual emissions in any given year, 
rather than 50% of the emission reductions necessary to 
achieve the company’s target. In other words, companies could 
still qualify to make some (currently undefined) form of claim 
regarding their scope 3 targets, even if their emissions are 
double the levels implied by the target trajectory in any given 
year. In most cases, companies could significantly increase 
their emissions between 2019 and 2030 and still remain 
eligible for the claim.

To illustrate the implications of the Scope 3 Flexibility Claim, 
we tested it for the 14 companies covered in this report 
with SBTi-validated 2030 targets that can be broken down 
to scope 3 specifically. Of the 14 companies, 11 would be 
entitled to the flexibility to even increase (8) or plateau (3) their 
scope 3 emissions between 2019 and 2030, rendering these 
companies’ current scope 3 targets effectively meaningless. 
Figure 4 demonstrates the implications of this for companies’ 
overall commitments to value chain emission reductions 
between 2019 and 2030 (including a combination of all their 
targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions), showing that the 
proposed 50% flexibility mechanism would nullify the scope 3 
commitments of most companies and leave them accountable 
only to their scope 1 and 2 targets.

Under VCMI’s beta proposal, the role of carbon credits to 
“bridge the gap” should phase out by 2035 at the latest. The 
phase-out by 2035 is identified as a “guardrail” for the Scope 
3 Flexibility Claim. However, it is questionable whether the 
proposed timeline for 2035 can send a meaningful signal to 
companies, given the high probability of further developments 
to the rulebooks and recommendations related to corporate 
accountability and claims over the next decade.

Any potential link between the VCMI scope 3 flexibility 
proposal and the SBTi target setting guidance remains 
unclear. In response to pressure from some stakeholders urging 
SBTi to reverse its long-standing position that companies’ 
short- and medium-term targets should not be met through 
offsetting, SBTi announced in September 2023 an open call 
for evidence on the effectiveness of carbon credits and other 
certificates used for offsetting claims. At COP28 in December

Note: Data includes 14 companies, including all companies from the CCRM 2024 sample with SBTi validations and targets that can be broken down to specific scopes. The 14  companies 
in this figure are only used as examples; we are not aware and do not intend to imply that these companies have indicated an intention to make use of the Scope 3 Flexibility Claim. The 
data points in this chart represents the authors' interpretation of companies' emission reduction commitments, based on publicly available information. The data points include the following 
optimistic assumptions: (1) Emission intensity targets are assumed to result in equivalent absolute emission reductions (2) Although most of the companies would be entitled under the

The colour of the data points represents our assessment of the integrity of company's 2030 targets, based on their sufficiency compared to sector-specific 1.5 °C aligned benchmarks, 
and the appropriateness of the terminology used in the pledge communication.

Unnuanced flexibility to offset scope 3 emissions is not the right solution to address the challenges that companies understandably face in implementing 
targets. Instead, the GHG Protocol and SBTi Net Zero Standard revision processes are an opportunity to reconsider the categorisation of value chain emissions 
to focus on the most critical decarbonisation indicators for each sector which are well within companies’ direct control.

Scope 3 emission reduction targets represent a serious 
challenge for companies. But it is far too simple to suggest 
that scope 3 emissions are outside of the direct influence of 
companies. In particular, the materials that companies choose 
to procure and the products that their produce are the most 
relevant business decisions that determine the extent to which 
companies’ transition plans are aligned with the objectives 
of the Paris Agreement. On these issues, there is no room 
for flexibility and offsetting is not the right solution. Instead 
of accounting approaches that lead to ambiguous claims, 
transparency and constructive dialogue are necessary when 
companies understandably fall short of the hugely challenging 
level of necessary ambition.

Instead of addressing the challenge through blanket flexibility 
across all scope 3 emission categories, the process to revise 
of the GHG Protocol and SBTi Net Zero Standard throughout 
2024 and 2025 offers the opportunity to reconsider the 
general approach to categorising and accounting for value 
chain emissions. GHG emission accounting for the value chain 
could better distinguish between those emission sources within 
companies’ direct influence that are of utmost importance 
to sector transitions, and other emission sources where 
companies genuinely have less information and control to 
lead the transition. Compiling all these emission sources under 
the extensive umbrella of ‘scope 3 emissions’ and formulating 
overarching targets across scope 3 may not afford sufficient 
focus to the most critical decarbonisation indicators for each 
sector, and may create non-trivial challenges for companies 
to account and plan for truly indirect emission sources where 
they may understandably lack the confidence to set targets 
without flexibility allowances.

Part of the rationale for scope 3 flexibility proposals is to 
increase the flow of voluntary climate finance to climate 
change mitigation projects worldwide through carbon 
crediting, but climate contributions (also referred to as Beyond 
Value Chain Mitigation) can also increase the flow of voluntary 
climate finance without compromising transparency and the 
requirement to decarbonise a company’s own emissions (see 
contribution claims in section 4.1).

1.3 Key challenges for improving science-aligned validations of corporate climate targets

Summary

The voluntary Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), as the 
largest and most influential validator of corporate climate 
targets, plays a crucial role in the current accountability 
system on credible corporate climate action. Our analysis 
comparing existing SBTi validations for 2030 targets with 
other analyses by independent assessors points to multiple 
areas for improvements of its current validation practice. These 
include a more stringent focus on scope 3 emissions as part 
of 2030 validations, addressing legacy issues stemming from 
outdated validations and validation methods, and the exclusion 
of potentially misleading ‘insetting’ practices. 

The SBTi might face multiple challenges to implement such 
timely improvements. As a voluntary and mostly third-
party funded initiative, the SBTi depends on the voluntary 
participation of companies and needs to accommodate the 
perspectives of different stakeholders when developing its 
validation methodologies. These contextual conditions may 
explain some of the existing flexibility in the system and might 
present a bottleneck for SBTi to further develop towards fully 
science-aligned validations that provide the necessary insights 
for investors, regulators, courts, and other stakeholders on 
1.5°C-aligned climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), 
as the largest and most influential validator of 
corporate targets and independent assessments, 
plays a critical role to validate corporate climate 
pledges towards 2030. A comparison between 
the ratings of SBTi and other assessors indicates 
a significant degree of leniency in current SBTi 
validation practices and points to multiple areas 
for improvements. 

Founded in 2015, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) 
has developed into the largest and most influential validator 
of corporate targets for 2030 and beyond. As of March 2024, 
the SBTi has validated more than 4,800 companies upon the 
voluntary request of companies (SBTi, 2024c), establishing 
itself as the de facto standalone validator of corporate climate 
targets (see Section 4.3 for further analysis on the current corporate 
accountability system). Diverse stakeholders including investors, 
regulators, the judiciary, and civil society use and rely on these 
validations to tell apart credible climate pledges that are in line 
with the Paris Agreement objectives, from those that are not.

Out of the 51 companies assessed between 2022 and 2024, 
28 are active in the four focus sectors of this analysis: fashion, 
automotive manufacturers, food and agriculture, and electric 
utilities. SBTi has validated the 2030 targets of 22 of these 
28 companies to be aligned with a pathway to limit global 
temperature increase to 1.5°C, ‘well-below 2°C’, or 2°C. 
Companies generally highlight these validations prominently 
in their climate-related communications.

The comparison between SBTi’s validations of 2030 targets 
and assessments by the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 
(CCRM), the Transition Pathways Initiative (TPI), the MSCI Net 
Zero Tracker, and the Planet Tracker identifies five distinct 
areas for improvements of its current validation practice (see 
Table 5 below for detailed overview).

� Temperature classifications of target validations for 
2030 usually do not apply to large shares of 
companies’ value chains: Current validations of 2030 
targets – phrased as ‘target classifications’ that 
provide a temperature alignment – mostly cover 
operational scope 1 and 2 emissions (SBTi, 
2024e). Those temperature classifications do not 
apply to scope 3 targets in most cases, although 
companies’ scope 3 targets are also listed on SBTi’s 
website. A 1.5°C validation for a given scope 1 and 2 
target might in some cases only cover less than 5% of a 
company’s total footprint. SBTi’s ‘expansive boundary’ 
approach under its SBTi Net Zero Standard only 
requires companies to cover 67% of  all scope 3

emissions for 2030 or 2035 interim targets (SBTi, 2024d, 
p. 25). In some cases, the expansive boundary may be
a reasonable approach to allow companies to focus the
most important and accessible emission sources in the
short-term. However, the approach can also be used to
simply reduce a company’s apparent emission reduction
ambition across all emission sources. For example, Tesco
has SBTi-validated targets for 2032 for its non-FLAG
emissions that specifically cover 67% of each scope 3
emissions category (except for use of sold products).

	� SBTi’s validations across companies within respective 
sectors cover different emission shares along the 
entire value chain: Current validations of 2030 targets 
for different companies within a given sector can cover 
different emission scopes along companies’ value chains.  

• Automotive manufacturers: The Volvo Group’s 
temperature classification only covers scope 1 and 2, 
while the temperature classifications of other vehicle 
manufacturers cover scope 3 use phase emissions for LDVs.

• Electric utilities: Enel and Iberdrola’s temperature 
classifications include all scope 3 emission categories 
while ENGIE’s validation covers scope 3 category
1, 2, 3, 11 and 15.  E.ON’s temperature classification 
covers no scope 3 emission categories, although 
scope 3 emissions account for over 90% of the 
company’s GHG emission footprint.

• Fashion: Adidas’s temperature classification covers 
all scope 3 emissions while the temperature 
classifications of other fashion companies cover no 
scope 3 emission categories.

• Food and agriculture: Nestlé and Unilever’s 
temperature classifications includes parts of
their scope 3 emissions while the temperature 
classifications of all other seven food and agriculture 
companies that we assessed since 2022 do not cover 
any scope 3 emissions.

25Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



We could not identify an explanation of this different 
coverage within same sectors. These varying scope 
coverages make it difficult for external audiences to 
compare companies within any given sector. This is further 
complicated by the fact that many scope 3 targets listed 
do not receive a ‘target classification’ as of April 2024. 
Other assessors, such as the Transition Pathways Initiative 
(TPI), use consistent sector-specific methods covering 
specific emission scopes across all companies in each sector, 
offering a more uniform basis for comparison.

	� No disclosure of methods and underlying data used for 
specific validations: SBTi neither provides information 
on validation methods used for specific company 
validations, nor on underlying data inputs such as base 
year emissions. On the former, it remains unclear for 
an external audience whether SBTi uses sector-specific 
or cross-sectoral methods for specific validations. This 
reinforces the challenge to understand and compare the 
validations between companies within a given sector. 

	� Presentation of outdated validations dating back 
up to seven years and continued use of automotive 
manufactures validations based on methods 
discontinued by SBTi (‘legacy issues’): The SBTi 
continues to list outdated validations on their website, 
which are subsequently and continuously used by 
companies in their sustainability reporting. In addition, 
SBTi list ‘well-below 2°C’ validations for the scope 3 
emissions intensity targets for light duty-vehicles for 
automobile manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Toyota, 
Mercedes-Benz, or BMW despite indefinitely pausing 
the methodology’s use due to its 1.5°C-incompatibility 
since March 2022 (SBTi, 2022c). None of these 
companies have been validated under SBTi’s new interim 
guidance for automobile manufacturers, released in 
March 2024. This new guidance requires a “phase out of 
new ICE cars and vans by 2035 in leading markets and 
by 2040 globally” (SBTi, 2024f, pp. 16–17). Our analysis 
for Volkswagen and Toyota, for example, shows that 
neither of the two companies sets ICE phase-out targets 
in line with these requirements.

� Use of carbon dioxide removals within the value chain 
— sometimes referred to as ‘insetting’ — by companies 
operating in the forest, land, and agriculture (FLAG) 
sector: The SBTi FLAG guidance and the SBTi Net Zero 
Standard allow companies operating in the FLAG sector 
to use carbon dioxide removals within the value chain to 
meet their 2030 and net-zero targets (SBTi, 2023b, pp. 
27–28, 2024d, pp. 26–27). This concept — sometimes 
referred to as ‘insetting’ — includes approaches under 
which emissions are offset within the value chain rather 
than reduced. ‘Insetting’ through land sequestration 
carbon dioxide removals is not an equivalent alternative 
to emission reductions, among other reasons, due to high 
uncertainties regarding the permanence of outcomes and 
lack of certification (see Section 3.4 for detailed analysis). 
Nestlé and PepsiCo are examples of companies that rely 
on insetting to achieve 2030 pledges.  

Aside from the FLAG sector, the SBTi further allows for 
emission reduction measures that (partially) occur within 
a company’s scope 3 value chain to count towards target 
achievement under the term ‘insetting’ (SBTi, 2023c, 
pp. 13–14). The SBTi allows this insetting practice on 
“a case-by-case basis” despite pointing out the lack of 
standardised definitions and overall uncertainty around 
this approach (SBTi, 2023c, pp. 13–14). 

The SBTi might face multiple challenges to 
implement these timely improvements on 
its validation practice for 2030 targets due 
the voluntary nature of the initiative and the 
influence of diverse stakeholders.

As a voluntary and mostly third-party funded initiative, the 
SBTi depends on the voluntary participation of companies 
and needs to accommodate the perspectives of different 
stakeholders when developing its validation methodologies. 
These contextual conditions may explain some of the existing 
flexibility in the current validation practice and might present 
a bottleneck for SBTi to further develop towards fully science-
aligned validations that are timely and provide the necessary 
insights for investors, regulators, courts, and other stakeholders 
on 1.5°C-aligned climate action.

Without the initial improvement listed above, however, existing 
SBTi validations for 2030 targets continue to lend credibility 
to some companies whose targets are highly insufficient. This 
leads to undifferentiated validations of corporate targets, 
regardless of whether a company has set a 1.5°C-aligned 
target across the entire value chain or is lagging behind in 
climate action. As a result, SBTi’s 2030 validations currently 
do not fully provide the timely information to the diverse 
stakeholders who use and rely on these validations to tell apart 
companies that embark on the necessary transitions to align 
their business models with the Paris Agreement objectives, 
from those that do not.

KEY ISSUES EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SBTI TEMPERATURE RATINGS AND 
THE CCRM INTEGRITY ASSESSMENTS FOR CORPORATE TARGETS TOWARDS 2030

Legacy: The SBTi temperature ratings for intensity targets of light-duty vehicles’ 
use-phase emissions use a method permanently paused by the SBTi since March 2022 
(BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Volkswagen Group).

Exclusion: The SBTi temperature ratings do not cover upstream scope 3 emissions (all), 
HDV use-phase emissions (Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Volvo Group), and other 
downstream scope 3 emissions not related to use-phase emissions (all).  

Other: CCRM assessments considers a range of 1.5°C-specific decarbonisation 
milestones for specific geographies like the EU or US identified in the literature

Exclusion: The SBTi temperature ratings cover different emission scopes ranging from 
the coverage of all emission scopes (Enel, Iberdrola), partial coverage of scope 3 
emissions (Engie) to operational emissions only (E.ON).

Other: CCRM assessments considers a range of 1.5°C-specific decarbonisation 
milestones for specific geographies like the EU or US identified in the literature.

Exclusion: The SBTi temperature ratings for all companies except Adidas only cover 
operational emissions, excluding all scope 3 emissions (~95% of total emissions).

Disclosure: We cannot identify the SBTi method used for Adidas’ validation covering 
scope 3 emissions (e.g., cross-sectoral and/or sector-specific methods).

Other: CCRM assessments considers that no targets set within five-year intervals 
towards 2030 (H&M Group, Inditex, Nike).  

‘Insetting’: Several SBTi temperature ratings in the FLAG sector allow for the use of 
‘insetting’ within the value chain (Nestlé, PepsiCo, Unilever).

Outdatedness: The SBTi displays outdated temperature classifications on its webpage 
for targets dating back more than five years ago (Walmart). 

Exclusion: The majority of SBTi temperature ratings do not cover any upstream scope 3 
emissions (Ahold Delhaize, Carrefour, Danone, Mars, PepsiCo, Tesco, Walmart).  

Disclosure: We cannot identify the SBTi method used for validations (Ahold Delhaize, 
PepsiCo) and/or the underlying data relevant for the validation (Carrefour).

Other: CCRM assessments considers that no targets set within five-year intervals 
towards 2030 (Ahold Delhaize, Danone).  

27Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Our analysis indicates that the SBTi’s Net Zero Standard may provide a 
credible framework for net-zero targets that are substantiated by emission 
reduction commitments. However, the lack of clarity on the treatment 
of carbon dioxide removals within the value chain raises questions over 
validations in the forest, land, and agriculture (FLAG) sector, and compliance 
across sectors must be thoroughly and continuously monitored in the future.

Alongside validations for 2030 targets, SBTi has validated more than 730 companies’ net-zero 
targets as 1.5°C-aligned as of March 2024 (SBTi, 2024c). More than 1,900 companies have 
officially committed to setting net-zero targets in line with the SBTi Net Zero Standard, although 
SBTi has not yet validated their targets.

Among the 28 companies in the four focus sectors we assessed, six have had their net-zero 
pledges certified by SBTi under its Net Zero Standard. We find the net-zero pledges of Enel, 
Iberdrola, H&M Group, and Mars to be of reasonable integrity. SBTi’s Net Zero Standard 
mandates that net-zero pledges should equate to at least 90% emission reductions across the 
full value chain. This requirement directly addresses the key issues that undermine many other 
companies’ net-zero pledges, which either lack clarity or fail to commit to deep decarbonisation. 
The validated 2050 net-zero targets by Nestlé and Tesco under the FLAG sector, however, are 
prone to the same issues concerning the use of carbon dioxide removals within the value chain 
as those observed in 2030 target validations.

Another four of the 28 companies from the focus sectors assessed in this report have officially 
committed to the Net Zero Standard through SBTi’s webpage, but SBTi has not yet validated 
their targets. We evaluate the net-zero targets of two of those four companies to have very 
poor integrity (BMW, PepsiCo) and two others as reasonable (Ahold Delhaize, Inditex). In 
March 2024, SBTi removed previously made commitments by more than 200 companies from 
its target dashboard as these companies did not substantiate their net zero commitments with 
specific targets within the required time period (Robinson-Tillett, 2024; SBTi, 2024a). This 
affected five companies of the 28 companies assessed in this report (ENGIE, Carrefour, JBS, 
Unilever, Walmart), all of which we evaluated as of poor or very poor integrity.

1.4 Summary of recommendations for improving the integrity of corporate climate target setting

Recommendations for improving integrity of corporate climate target setting

	� Companies: Companies should follow an accelerated revision cycle for corporate climate 
targets towards 2030 to align their targets with the latest developments in science, 
technology, and validation methods. This revision process should incorporate the latest 
recommendations on corporate target setting, such as those from the UN High-Level 
Expert Group (UN HLEG) or the ISO Net Zero Principles. Short-, medium- and long-term 
targets should, among others, cover all emission scopes along the value chain including 
scope 3 value chain emissions, be set at least within five-year intervals, and be aligned 
with 1.5°C-compatible sector-specific pathways with no or limited overshoot.   

	� Regulators: Regulators should enact mandatory regulations to mandate companies 
to set legally binding targets and transition plans aligned with the 1.5°C trajectory. 
Such mandatory regulations — even if they encounter challenges like political lobbying 
themselves — could effectively address some of the existing shortcomings of a 
predominantly voluntary system that provides companies full flexibility on whether to 
follow existing voluntary guidance or not.   

	� Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi): The SBTi, as the largest and most influential 
validator of corporate climate targets, could implement improvements to ensure the high 
integrity of their ‘target classifications’ going forward. 

• Increase the frequency of the validation cycle for 2030 corporate climate targets
to align validations with the latest developments in validation methods and latest
scientific findings.

• Revise approach and develop methodologies to cover scope 3 emissions related to
key relevant emission sources along the value chain in SBTi’s target classifications.

• Remove outdated and ‘legacy’ validations issued several years ago or based on
methodologies that have been paused indefinitely, such as intensity targets for light-
duty vehicles in the automotive sector.

• Revise the SBTi’s FLAG guidance to specify minimum requirements for the reduction
of agricultural emissions, alongside carbon dioxide removals.

• Transparently disclose underlying data and methods for each validation and
communicate existing limitations affecting current validations.

	� SBTi, GHG Protocol and Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity (VCMI) initiative: The 
consultations by SBTi on the effectiveness of environmental attribute certificates in 
climate targets, the revision process of the GHG Protocol, and the finalisation of VCMI 
claims will take place throughout 2024 and 2025. 

• These processes should reaffirm that offsetting cannot play a role towards
company’s inventories and the achievement of companies’ emission reductions
targets. This position aligns with the recommendations of the UN HLEG, ISO Net
Zero Principles, and the original SBTi principles. The challenge of meeting the
necessary ambition poses understandable difficulties for companies. Resolving this
issue necessitates open dialogue and collaborative solutions, rather than resorting
to more ambiguous accounting approaches that obscure genuine progress.
The VCMI carbon integrity claims and the SBTi beyond value chain mitigation
recommendations offer a more transparent and constructive approach to scaling up
voluntary climate finance, compared to scope 3 ‘flexibility’ claims.

• Instead of addressing the challenges by allowing unnuanced flexibility in the form
of offsetting across all scope 3 emission categories, the GHG Protocol and SBTi
Net Zero Standard revision processes create an opportunity to reconsider the
categorisation of value chain emissions to focus on the most critical decarbonisation
indicators for each sector, which are well within companies’ direct control.

29Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



2.1 Some sectors on the right track but accelerated efforts required

2 Mixed progress towards critical sector transitions

Summary

Only four of the 20 companies assessed present emission reduction measures that have 
reasonable integrity. These are Enel, Danone, Iberdrola and Volvo Group. We evaluated the 
measures of another four companies to have moderate integrity, while over half of the companies 
receive a poor or very poor integrity rating for their emission reduction plans. For some companies, 
we identify a strong gap between ambitious targets and the absence of underlying measures 
(see section 1.1).

Overall, we find that the European electric utilities are on the right track when it comes to 
ramping up renewable energy generation, although increased deployment is necessary to meet 
regional 1.5ºC-aligned benchmarks for electricity generation. Enel is the only one of the electric 
utilities present a comprehensive plan to phase out all fossil fuels (see Section 3.1). Automotive 
manufacturers are also moving in the right direction – albeit at a slow pace. All automotive 
manufacturers we assessed in our report present plans for phasing in electric vehicles, which 
is critical to eliminate use-phase emissions. In the food and agriculture sector, most companies 
are reluctant to implement deep and comprehensive emission reduction measures, although we 
identified some promising exceptions. Four of the five fashion companies assessed set ambitious 
2030 targets, but none present convincing plans on how to reduce emissions.

Most companies assessed in this report do not take the necessary measures to significantly reduce 
their GHG emissions. The sectoral transition frameworks in section B describe what measures 
companies active in the four focus sectors of this report should take to place themselves on a 
1.5ºC-aligned trajectory. Only four of the 20 companies assessed in this report present measures 
that have reasonable integrity (see Table 7). These are Enel, Danone, Iberdrola and Volvo Group. 
We evaluated the emission reduction measures of another four companies – Mars, Stellantis, 
Volkswagen Group, and Walmart – to have moderate integrity.  The other 12 companies do 
not implement the measures that would be necessary for sectoral transitions.

Table 7: Overview of key emission reduction measures implemented by the 20 companies assessed in the CCRM 2024.

EVALUATION OF EMISSION REDUCTION MEASURES

Volvo Group (HDV)
The company present targets for procurement of low-carbon steel and aluminium (upstream scope 3, 4% of 2022 emissions). Relevant measures for use-phase emissions presented, including zero-emission vehicle technologies and 
charging infrastructure. Plans to sell ICEs using biofuels and e-fuels in 2040, even though battery electric vehicles are technologically possible.

Stellantis (LDV)
Plans to address upstream scope 3 emissions (about 10% of 2022 emissions) lack detail. The company presents relevant measures to reduce downstream scope 3 emissions (90% of 2022 emissions), including phasing in electric vehicles. 
Targets for EV phase-in not aligned with sectoral benchmarks for all markets.

Volkswagen Group (LDV and HDV)
Several measures to reduce upstream scope 3 emissions (about 15% of 2022 emissions) presented, but limited details on timeline, milestones, and expected impact. The company present plans to address downstream scope 3 emissions 
(about 85% of 2022 emissions), but limited details on the timeline and expected impact. While the company’s phase in targets for electric LDVs fall short of sectoral benchmarks, its targets for HDVs are aligned with Paris-compatible 
sectoral benchmarks.

Daimler Truck (HDV)
No measures to reduce key upstream scope 3 emission sources. Relevant measures for use phase emissions, including zero emission vehicle technologies and charging infrastructure. Limited details on the timeline and impact up to 2030.

Toyota (LDV and HDV)
No measures to reduce upstream scope 3 emissions (20% of 2022 emissions) identified. The company present some plans to address downstream scope 3 emissions (about 80% of 2022 emissions), but with limited details on scope and 
timeline. Its target for phasing in EVs in the EU and UK falls short of regional benchmarks.

Enel
Commitment to phase out coal by 2027 and gas by 2040; and to rapidly increase the share of renewables in electricity generation. Pace is not quite sufficient to fully align with EU benchmarks. 

Iberdrola
Coal power plants phased out in 2020, but no comprehensive strategy to end fossil gas sales. Ambitious renewable deployment plan for 2030.

Engie
Plans to phase out coal, but not gas power plants; the company invests in CCUS development to continue using fossil gas. No clear support for large-scale electrification of end consumers. Renewable ramp up is insufficient.

Duke Energy
Commitment to phase out coal by 2035 and gas by 2050, falling short of US benchmarks. Limited investments in renewables and targets for renewable energy generation fall short of global benchmarks.

KEPCO
Inadequate targets for renewable electricity generation; the company plans for a delayed coal phase out and plans for CCUS and co-firing with hydrogen risk a lock in of fossil gas.

Adidas

Danone
Several measures to reduce upstream scope 3 emissions identified (about 80% of 2022 emissions), including a plan to increase the share of plant-based protein.

Mars
The company commits to relevant measures to reduce its emission sources in the upstream value chain (around 80% of 2022 emissions) to meet its 2030 target. However, the company neither considers measures for upstream emissions 
post-2030 nor introduces measures of its downstream value chain (responsible for 16% of 2022 emissions).

Walmart
Supplier engagement programme presented for significant upstream scope 3 emission sources (over 90% of 2022 emissions), but information lacks detail. 

Nestlé
Some measures to reduce upstream scope 3 emissions identified (about 80% of 2022 emissions), but these include uncertain measures such as regeneration. Little measures that will lead to deep decarbonisation presented.

Tesco
No measures identified that meaningfully reduce either upstream or downstream scope 3 emissions (respectively 55% and 43% of 2022 emissions).

Decarbonising the power system requires both a significant ramp up of renewable electricity 
generation and a rapid phase out of fossil fuels. Increasing renewable capacity, especially from 
wind and solar, is key to decarbonise the power system (CAT, 2023b, p. 16). Globally, 59-89% of 
electricity should be from renewables by 2030, growing to 85-99% by 2040 and 89-100% by 2050 
(IEA, 2022b, p. 197, 2023c, p. 197; Teske, 2022, p. 296; Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; CAT, 2023b, 
p. 16; IRENA, 2023c, pp. 22, 75). In advanced economies, however, the transition to renewable 
electricity generation should go at a faster pace. In the EU, renewables should account for close 
to 90% of electricity generation in 2030 and close to 100% by 2040 (CAT, 2023b, p. 16). While 
phasing in renewable capacity, electric utilities should phase out fossil fuels to avoid stranded 
assets and locked-in emissions that will derail us from staying in a 1.5°C trajectory (IEA, 2023c).

In the electric utilities sector, commitments to phasing out coal for own generation are in 
place, but we need clearer plans for phasing out fossil gas — both in electricity generation 
and sales — and for the electricity purchased for resale. All five electric utilities present plans 
for phasing out coal, but with strong differences on the timeline: whereas Iberdrola phased out 
coal in 2020, KEPCO plans to do so only in 2050 (see Table 11 in Section 3.1). A 1.5°C-aligned 
plan to phase out fossil gas is still missing for four out of five companies: Enel is the only one 
to commit to phasing out gas across its value chain. Section 3.1 discussed the electric utilities’ 
fossil fuel phase-out plans in more detail.

All electric utilities assessed plan to ramp up renewable electricity generation, but just two 
of the five set renewable targets that put them on a Paris-aligned trajectory. Iberdrola, Enel 
and – to a lesser extent – ENGIE have scaled up their renewable generation capacity in recent 
years (see Table 8 and Table 9). Iberdrola’s and Enel’s 2030 targets meet the global benchmark of 
59–89% of electricity generation and 68–77% of total installed capacity by 2030 (IEA, 2022b, p. 
197, 2023c, p. 197; Teske, 2022, p. 296; Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; CAT, 2023b, p. 16; IRENA, 
2023c, pp. 22, 75). However, both companies may need to increase their efforts to meet 
European benchmarks, which show that renewables should generate close to 90% of electricity 
generation by the end of this decade (CAT, 2023b, p. 16). Although ENGIE is also ramping up 
its renewable capacity, the company’s target of 58% installed capacity by 2030 falls short of 
global and European benchmarks. 

Renewables account for a minor share of Duke Energy’s and KEPCO’s portfolios today (see 
Table 8 and Table 9). Although both companies aim to significantly ramp up their renewable 
electricity generation until 2030, their efforts are insufficient to put them on a Paris-aligned 
trajectory. Both companies commit to a share of about 20% renewable electricity generation 
by 2030, which means a doubling of Duke Energy’s current renewable electricity generation 
and a seven-fold increase of KEPCO’s. However, global benchmarks require that renewables 
account for at least 59% of electricity generation by 2030. In the US, where Duke Energy 
operates, this should be at least 68% (CAT, 2023b, p. 16).

Table 9: Electric utilities' renewable generation portfolios and targets

Electric utilities are moving in the right direction, but increased efforts to generate renewable electricity are necessary.

Phasing out internal combustion engines and replacing them with electric vehicles is crucial 
to transform the automotive sector. By far the largest source of automotive manufacturers’ 
GHG footprint is the combustion of fossil fuels when their cars, trucks or buses are used. For 
the companies assessed in this report, use phase emissions (scope 3, category 11) account for 
over 80% of all reported emissions. Electric vehicles powered by decarbonised electricity have 
a large potential to reduce the GHG emissions of light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles (IPCC, 
2022; Jaramillo et al., 2022). Phasing out vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE) is 
the most important measure that automotive manufacturers should take to align their business 
with a 1.5º-compatible trajectory. Enabling measures to support the roll-out of vehicle charging 
infrastructure and to support demand management solutions can complement automotive 
manufacturers’ climate strategies (Pathak et al., 2022; Boehm et al., 2023; IEA, 2023b). 

Although automotive manufacturers acknowledge the need to phase in electric light-duty 
vehicles (LDVs), the transition is not going fast enough. The share of LDV sales in 2022 
for Stellantis, Toyota and Volkswagen Group were 5%, 0.2%, and 7% respectively. All three 
companies plan to rapidly increase these shares until 2030, but the transition to EVs needs to 
go much faster than the pace anticipated by Stellantis, Toyota, and Volkswagen (see Table 8). 
Only Stellantis’ target for Europe meets 1.5°C-aligned milestones, which show that by 2030, 
sales of electric light-duty vehicles should reach 67%–95% globally and 95–100% in the EU 
and US (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4; WBA, 2022; 
Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). The LDV manufacturers’ targets for 
the European market are more ambitious than their targets for other regions. We expect this 
is the result of the EU and individual member states setting tentative phase-out dates for ICEs 
earlier than the Chinese and US governments (see section 2.2 and IEA (2023b, p. 89)).

Two of the three heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) manufacturers assessed set Paris-aligned zero-
emission vehicles sales targets for most of their brands (see Table 10). In 2022, 4.5% of global 
bus sales and 1.2% of global truck sales were EVs (IEA, 2023b, p. 32). These shares need to 
increase by over 2,000% until the ends of this decade: by 2030, 56-60% of global bus sales and 
30-37% of global truck sales need to be battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric
vehicles (FECVs) (UNFCCC, 2021; Boehm et al., 2023; IEA, 2023c). Volvo Group and Volkswagen 
Group’s subsidiaries MAN, Navistar, Scania, and Volkswagen Truck & Bus committed to EV
phase-in targets for 2030 that could be aligned with Paris-compatible benchmarks: aiming
for at least 35% and 40%, respectively. In contrast, Daimler Truck frames its target to sell “up
to 60%” of zero-emission vehicles by 2030 as an aspirational goal with no minimum bound.
Depending on the sales share that Daimler Truck will achieve by the end of this decade, the
company could meet or massively fall short of sectoral benchmarks.

Charging infrastructure for HDVs is less developed than for LDVs. To address this issue, the three 
HDV manufacturers formed a joint venture to invest EUR 0.5 billion to roll out a high-performance 
public charging network for battery electric trucks and coaches (Volvo Group, 2023a, p. 35). 

Table 10: Light-duty vehicle and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers’ 2030 targets  
for the phase-in of battery electric vehicles

Automotive manufacturers are phasing in electric vehicles, but not yet at the pace needed to place the sector on a 1.5ºC-aligned trajectory.

Large fashion brands are implementing some measures to electrify manufacturing processes and switch to renewables but not yet at the scale needed.  
Measures to reduce emissions from material production are questionable and may distract from real solutions.

Fashion companies need to implement a set of measures 
to decarbonise their business, including electrification 
and switching to renewables in the supply chain, investing 
in innovative low-carbon materials, and stopping 
overproduction. Over 95% of fashion brands’ emissions 
occur in the supply chain, with about 75% attributable to 
energy-intensive manufacturing processes (Sadowski et al., 
2021; Sadowski, 2023). Thermal energy to produce steam 
and hot water accounts for a substantial share of the total 
energy demand in the sector. For instance, in China, Japan, 
and Taiwan, thermal energy represents over half of the total 
energy demand in the textile industry (Hasanbeigi and Zuberi, 
2022). Often, manufacturers of fabrics and other materials 
(tier 2) and suppliers assembling the final products (tier 1) 
use on-site coal-fired boilers. Electrifying heat and steam 
processes can substantially reduce the fashion sector’s 
energy demand and GHG emissions, for instance, through 
industrial heat pumps, electric steam boilers, and electric 
processing equipment (Hasanbeigi and Zuberi, 2022). 
Raw materials production accounts for about a quarter of 
fashion companies’ total GHG footprint (Sadowski et al., 
2021; Sadowski, 2023). These emissions can be reduced 
by investing in the development of innovative materials, 
including biosynthetic fibres and hemp, which have a lower 
carbon footprint than fabrics commonly used in the fashion 
sector (Ley et al., 2021; Sadowski et al., 2021; Sadowski, 
2023). In addition, stopping overproduction and moving away 
from the fast fashion business model are crucial to place the 
fashion industry on a 1.5ºC-aligned trajectory.

While all five fashion companies assessed work to increase 
renewable electricity in the supply chain, clear targets and 
a comprehensive package of measures are missing. H&M 
Group is the only fashion company assessed to commit to 
100% renewable electricity in the supply chain by 2030 (H&M 
Group, 2023d, p. 26). Inditex commits to 50% renewable 
electricity in manufacturing processes by 2030 (Inditex, 2024b, 
p. 10). However, there are caveats to these pledges, including 
potential reliance on renewable electricity certificates (RECs), 
the lack of a commitment to electrify manufacturing processes, 
and a switch to biomass to replace coal in the supply chain 
(see section 3.2 for a discussion on the limitations of RECs and 
section 3.3 for more details on the issues with bioenergy). Four 
of the five companies report measures to support suppliers 
with the procurement of renewable electricity. Adidas, 
H&M Group, Nike, and Inditex all report capacity building 
measures, incentive instruments and/or financial support. 
For instance, Nike offers suppliers in China, Vietnam, and 
Indonesia technical advice and assistance for on-site solar PV 
(Nike, 2023, p. 98); Inditex developed an online knowledge 
platform (Inditex, 2023a, p. 205); and Adidas incorporated 
renewable energy and decarbonisation performance in its 
supplier assessment process (Adidas, 2023b, p. 84). Despite 
these encouraging signals, none of the companies assessed 
present a comprehensive package of measures to electrify 
their supply chains, raising concerns about the feasibility 
of the companies’ ambitious 2030 targets. In addition, all 
five fashion companies use biomass in the supply chain and 
some explicitly consider this as a measure to reduce coal 
reliance and GHG emissions. Strong reliance on biomass could 
undermine companies’ decarbonisation efforts, as biomass 
is not an emissions-free energy source and has several other 
negative sustainability implications, including biodiversity 
loss (see section 3.3).

None of the five fashion companies present concrete plants 
to scale up the use of innovative low-carbon materials. Adidas, 
Fast Retailing, H&M Group, Inditex, and Nike all claim to use 
recycled materials, most notably cotton and polyester (Adidas, 
2023b, p. 88; Fast Retailing, 2023b, p. 17; H&M Group, 2023d, 
p. 45; Inditex, 2023a, p. 189; Nike, 2023, pp. 103–104). While 
the term “recycled materials” has a positive connotation, it 
does not significantly lower GHG emissions and may distract 
companies from the need to search for real solutions. Less 
than 1% of materials used to produce clothing is recycled and 
used for new clothing (Morlet et al., 2017). Recycled polyester 
in the fast sector generally comes from PET bottles from the 
beverage industry (Cobbing and Vicaire, 2017; Majumdar et 
al., 2020). By buying large amounts of PET bottles, fashion 
companies drive the need for virgin plastics – made with 
crude oil – in other sectors. Similarly, for “recycled cotton,” 
it is unclear whether companies recycle used and discarded 
clothing, or rather unsold clothes, in which case “recycling” 
distracts from the need to reduce overproduction. Some of 
the companies are investing in the development of innovative 
materials (e.g., H&M Group, 2023d, p. 47; Inditex, 2023b, 
p. 10), but these efforts need to be massively scaled up to 
reduce the fashion sector’s climate and other sustainability 
impacts (see section 7.2).

None of the five fashion companies present concrete 
measures to reduce overproduction and move away from 
their fast fashion business model, which would be critical 
to bring the fashion sector as a whole on a Paris-aligned 
trajectory. The production of clothing doubled between 2000 
and 2015 and consumers discard many items after just seven to 
ten wears (Morlet et al., 2017). While electrification, switching 
to renewable energy, and investing in innovative low-carbon 
materials are crucial measures, they should be underpinned 
by a shift to a more circular fashion system. However, none of 
the companies assessed set targets to reduce overproduction 
(i.e. clothes that are never sold) or to move away from their 
fast fashion business model. While we found some examples 
of repair, reuse and resale services, the fashion companies in 
this report implement these measures only at a small scale.

Most food and agriculture companies do not commit to transitioning to plant-
based products, which is necessary to reduce the sector’s methane emissions.
Increasing the share of plant-based protein is crucial to reduce methane emissions in the 
food and agriculture sector. The food and agriculture sector is responsible for roughly a third 
of global emissions (Crippa et al., 2021; Boehm et al., 2023). Even if all sectors would phase out 
fossil fuels immediately, the global food and agriculture sector could prevent the achievement of 
the 1.5°C temperature goal (Clark et al., 2020). The most important source of emissions in the 
sector is livestock, which generates high amounts of methane emissions. Methane is a potent 
greenhouse gas and has an almost immediate effect on global temperatures, contrary to carbon 
dioxide, which takes several decades. Due to its short-lived nature, reducing methane emissions 
can have a cooling effect (Collins et al., 2018). Bringing the agricultural and food sector on a 
trajectory compatible with 1.5ºC pathways requires a shift from animal-based to plant-based 
protein. Other measures that companies can take to reduce methane emissions from livestock 
include increasing feed quality, improved manure management. synthetic methane inhibitors, 
and the use of seaweed as a feed additive (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 7). Section 8.2 provides 
more information on sectoral transition measures for the food and agriculture sector.

Of the 11 agrifood companies we assessed in this and previous iterations of the CCRM,3 
Danone is the only company to indicate intent to increase the share of plant-based protein. 
The company states its goal is to “increase the share of revenue from lower carbon products 
transitioning to a low-carbon product offer as a main source of business” (Danone, 2023b, p. 36). 
Plant-based dairy alternatives are a key pillar of Danone’s “lower-carbon product development 
strategy” (Danone, 2023b, p. 36).  Nestlé also mentions a shift to “low carbon products, such as 
plant-based foods and drinks” in its Net Zero Roadmap and projects this can lead to emission 
reductions of 1.4 MtCO2e by 2030, which equals about 1% of today’s emissions (Nestlé, 2023b, 
pp. 21,23-24). However, Nestlé does not explain what the role of plant-based products vis-à-
vis other products will be; the company does not commit to increase the share of plant-based 
products. We did not identify any reference to the need for an increased share of plant-based 
proteins in Mars, Tesco, and Walmart’s public communications.

Danone is also the only agrifood company to have set a target for methane emissions. Danone 
commits to reduce methane emissions from fresh milk by 30% between 2020 and 2030 (Danone, 
2023c, p. 3). Fresh milk accounts for about 70% of Danone’s methane emissions. In its methane 
strategy, the company presents plans to achieve its methane target through improved herd 
and feed management, manure management, and innovative feed additives, among others 
(Danone, 2023c, pp. 7–11). The other 10 agrifood companies that we assessed do not set a 
target for methane emissions. 

3    These include the CCRM 2022, 2023 and 2024, and a spin-off report assessing climate targets of companies 
based in the Netherlands.

2.2 Regulations and technology development driving energy transitions

Summary

Of the five electric utilities assessed, the three European 
ones (Enel, ENGIE, and Iberdrola) present more ambitious 
renewable energy and emission reduction targets than Duke 
Energy and KEPCO,  headquartered in the US and South 
Korea, respectively. Likewise, the three light-duty vehicle  
manufacturers in this report (Stellantis, Toyota, and Volkswagen 
Group) provide more ambitious targets for the European 
market than for other regions. While this report does not 
delve into the underlying reasons for these differences, it 
suggests that EU legislation and political commitment may 
play a significant role in driving more ambitious climate action 
among some of these companies.

European regulations drive the shift to renewable electricity generation.

The EU committed to increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 42.5% by 2030, which means a doubling from 
2022 levels (European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2023b; Eurostat, 2023). The share of renewable 
electricity would need to increase to 69% by 2030 (European Commission, 2022). In December 2023, seven European countries, 
including the EU’s two largest economies, committed to decarbonise their electricity systems by 2035 (Government of the 
Netherlands, 2023). The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the Union’s key instrument to drive emission reductions in 
the power sector, but other measures such as subsidies and R&D support also stimulate investments in renewable energy 
capacity (Bölük and Kaplan, 2022). Policy changes in European member states like Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands 
led to a rapid increase in renewable electricity generation in recent years (Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 33–34).

Compared to Europe, the transition to renewables has been slower in the US and South Korea, where Duke Energy and KEPCO 
are headquartered. The climate strategies of these two electric utilities appear to be in line with national policies. Although 
the Biden administration announced a target of a carbon free electricity system by 2035 and the share of renewables in the 
electricity sector is growing, existing policies do not result in penetration levels deep enough to bring the US on track to meet 
sectoral benchmarks (CAT, 2023d, p. 9). The slower uptake of renewables in the US compared to the EU is due to the existing 
contribution of nuclear power to the US grids and a lack of policies incentivising the phase-out of oil and gas (CAT, 2023d, p. 
9). The US government’s proposed emission standards for existing fossil gas facilities do not cover the majority of fossil plants, 
and the Inflation Reduction Act provides substantial concessions to the fossil fuel industry (CAT, 2023d, 2023f). Duke Energy’s 
climate strategy aligns with national policies – the company plans for nuclear to continue playing an important role in electricity 
generation and for co-firing of hydrogen and fossil gas (Duke Energy, 2023a, pp. 48–49). Likewise, KEPCO, which is state-run, 
views fossil gas as a “transitional” fuel and also plans for the co-firing of hydrogen and fossil gas, as well as an expansion of 
nuclear (KEPCO, 2023, p. 31). This mirrors national policies in South Korea. The South Korean government increased its nuclear 
power generation target in 2023 and plans to increase the use of liquified natural gas (LNG) in the power sector (CAT, 2023e). 
The Yoon Suk-yeol administration has dropped South Korea’s 100% renewable energy target. While the share of renewables in 
electricity generation doubled in recent years, it remains small at about 6%, much lower than in countries like the EU, the US, 
and Japan (CAT, 2023e).

Regulation and financial incentives for consumers to buy EVs may also explain why the light-duty 
(LDV) manufacturers assessed set more ambitious targets for the EU than for China and the US, and no 
targets for other markets.

The three LDV manufacturers in this report (Stellantis, Toyota, and Volkswagen Group) set more ambitious targets for electric 
vehicle (EV) sales shares in the EU than in the US and China. They do not communicate EV sales targets for other regions. As 
shown in Table 10 above, Volkswagen committed to selling at least 70% electric LDVs in the EU and at least 50% electric LDVs 
in the US and China by 2030. Stellantis set an electric LDV sales target of 100% in Europe and 50% in the US by 2050; however, 
the company did not set a target for the Chinese market, where it holds a minor share (<1%) of the car market. Toyota committed 
to a 50% sales share of battery electric vehicles in the EU and the UK by 2030 and does not present targets for the US and China. 

36Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



As a result of enabling policies and regulatory requirements, 
EV sales have reached a breakthrough stage in advanced 
economies (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 85). In 2022, EV sales for 
passenger cars reached 29% in China, 21% in the EU, and 
8% in the US (IEA, 2023b, p. 16,18,20). Enabling policies, 
including subsidies for consumers and charging infrastructure 
rollout, helped accelerate the share of EVs in these three 
markets. The Chinese government started financial support 
for new energy vehicles (NEV), which include battery electric 
vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell 
electric vehicles (FCEV), in the 1990s, and subsidy schemes 
boosted sales shares (CAT, 2023a). While NEV subsidies for 
producers ended in 2022, consumers can still benefit from 
tax exemptions until the end of 2027 (CAT, 2023a; Xinhuanet, 
2023). Many European governments set up subsidy schemes 
to incentivise the purchase of electric LDV, but as the market 
for EVs has matured, they are reducing or changing the nature 
of purchase incentives (IEA, 2023b, p. 77). Both in China and 
several European countries, governments are now shifting 
their financial support from vehicles to charging infrastructure 
(IEA, 2023b, p. 83). In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 
incentivises investments in EVs and charging infrastructure 
(CAT, 2023f; IEA, 2023b). 

The European Union pledged more ambitious targets for 
reducing CO2 emissions from new cars and vans than the US 
and China. The EU adopted targets to reduce CO2 emissions 
from new cars and vans by 55% and 50% by 2030 and 100% 
by 2035, compared to 2021 (European Parliament and the 
Council of the European Union, 2023a). This implies that the 
overwhelming majority of new light-duty vehicles sold by 2035 
will likely be battery electric vehicles, with perhaps a small 
share of other zero-emission cars. The Biden administration set 
a goal of a 50% sales share of zero emissions vehicles by 2030 
(The White House, 2021), but the US government estimates 
that LDV EV sales will reach only 22% by 2030 (CAT, 2023f). 
Some federal states, which together account for about 25% of 
car sales in the US, go beyond this national target. California 
was the first to adopt legislation that requires a minimum sales 
share of EVs of 35% in 2026 and 100% in 2035 (IEA, 2023b, 
pp. 74–75). China targets a 50% sales share of NEV in “key 
air pollution control regions”, which account for almost 80% 
of China’s LDV market (IEA, 2023b, p. 77). Several regions 
within China committed to targets that surpass the national 
level. For instance, Shanghai aims for a 50% of BEVs by 2025. 

Section 2.1 showed that the five automotive manufacturers 
assessed set more ambitious targets for the EU than for other 
markets. This is likely the consequence of more stringent 
regulation in the EU, compared to the US and China and IEA 
(2023b, p. 89). To support the increase of EV sales shares in 
other markets, especially less mature ones, regulators could 
adopt legislation on tailpipe emissions or EV sales shares, 
implement subsidy schemes for consumers buying EVs, and 
providing financial incentives for investments in charging 
infrastructure roll-out, among others.

Separating real transition pathways from false narratives3
3.1 Fossil fuel phase-out and CCUS: limited traction for HLEG recommendations

Summary

Despite being one of the main levers to reduce emissions in the 
power, automotive, and fashion sectors, only a minority of the 
companies assessed in our analysis commit to a fossil fuel phase-
out. A phase-out of coal and fossil gas is particularly crucial in 
the energy sector as this is a prerequisite for decarbonising 
other high-emitting sectors through electrification. Most electric 
utilities in our analysis address the need to exit coal, but fossil 
gas is still seen as ‘transitional fuels’, especially outside Europe. 
The automotive sector lags in phasing out internal combustion 
engines. The fashion sector has started to reduce coal from its 
production processes, but a full commitment is yet to be made. 
Overall, we find that companies' commitments to phase out 
fossil fuels largely depend on the regulatory environment at the 
national and regional levels, as transitioning to alternatives must 
take place in parallel and requires dedicated incentive schemes.

International consensus on the need to move away 
from fossil fuels is facing strong resistance and is 
being countered by powerful vested interests.

The majority of companies with net-zero targets have not 
committed to fossil fuel phase-out despite the international 
agreement on transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy 
systems. Although climate policies focused on the energy sector 
from the outset, it took several decades for the international 
community to reach an agreement — albeit weak — on phasing 
out fossil fuels. At COP27, parties agreed on the necessity 
to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems and to 
accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal 
power (UNFCCC, 2023a, p. 5). Recommendations on fossil 
phase-out commitments in corporate climate guidelines are 

Furthermore, to meet the stricter EU Air Quality Directive in 
2021, coal plants owners were faced with the costly decision 
to either retrofit their facilities with expensive technologies or 
close their facilities (Wynn and Coghe, 2017). Pressure from 
investors and NGOs, as well as political will, are also considered 
significant drivers of change in Europe (Czyżak et al., 2022; 
Beyond Fossil Fuels, 2024).

Despite the positive steps taken by these companies to phase 
out coal, a 1.5°C-aligned plan to phase out fossil gas is still 
missing for four out of five companies. Fossil gas accounts 
for 36% of Duke Energy’s installed capacity, 49% of ENGIE’s 
installed capacity, 21% of KEPCO’s installed capacity, and 15% 
of Iberdrola’s own installed capacity (KEPCO, 2022, p. 11; Duke 
Energy, 2023b, p. 37; ENGIE, 2023, p. 3; Iberdrola, 2023b, p. 
101, 2023d, p. 19). Duke Energy and KEPCO will only phase 
out gas by 2050 (KEPCO, 2022, p. 59,68; Duke Energy, 2023a, 
pp. 48–49), which is 15 years beyond the advised timeline for 
developed countries (CAT, 2023b, p. 1). Iberdrola has not publicly 
announced a comprehensive strategy for complete fossil gas 
phase-out in its electricity generation and sales. Duke Energy, 
KEPCO, and ENGIE do not plan to decommission gas-fired 
power plants after 2030, but instead view gas as “transitional 
fuels”. They also rely on hydrogen blending in gas turbines, view 
gas as a suitable flexibility option in the decarbonisation of the 
energy sector and support the use of CCS to extend the life of 
gas-fired power plants (Duke Energy, 2022, pp. 18, 67, 2023a, p. 
43; KEPCO, 2022, p. 64; ENGIE, 2023, p. 66). Only Enel pledges 
to completely phase out gas in its electricity generation and retail 
gas sales by 2040, which meets global benchmarks (Enel, 2023a, 
p.86). While gas phase-out is a major concern, oil phase-out 
is less critical for most companies in our analysis since it only 
accounts for an insignificant share of the companies’ power 
generation capacity (KEPCO, 2022, p. 11; Duke Energy, 2023b, 
p. 37; ENGIE, 2023, p. 3).

also recent and have not yet become widely adopted. An explicit 
reference to the phase-out of fossil fuels is integrated in the HLEG 
recommendations (UN HLEG, 2022, p. 24). HLEG recommends 
phasing out coal for power generation across the entire value 
chain by 2030 in OECD countries and by 2040 in the rest of 
the world, as well as ending oil and gas exploration, expansion, 
and production. However, the explicit requirements for fossil 
fuel phase-out have sparked controversy due to concerns that 
they might violate anti-competition regulations, especially in the 
US (Hearn et al., 2023, p. 33). Therefore, we understand that 
some corporate initiatives are reluctant to incorporate the HLEG 
recommendations into their guidelines. The Net Zero Tracker 
found that the majority of companies with net-zero targets 
have not committed to phasing out fossil fuels (Lutz, 2023, p. 6).

In the electric utilities sector, commitments to 
phasing out coal for own generation are in place, 
but we need clearer plans for phasing out fossil 
gas — both in electricity generation and sales — 
and for the electricity purchased for resale.

All electric utilities assessed have planned to phase out coal; 
however, there are stark differences in their timelines. Iberdrola 
has already shut down its last coal-powered plants as early 
as 2020, while Enel and ENGIE have committed to do so by 
2027, and Duke Energy by 2035 (although this is contingent 
on regulatory approvals), with KEPCO committing to phase out 
coal only by 2050 (see Table 11). European power companies 
appear to be outperforming their non-European peers for 
several reasons. Among them, coal is no longer profitable in the 
EU. Since 2013, European electric utilities have been required 
to auction their allowances in the EU emissions trading scheme. 
The recent reform of the scheme as part of the EU Fit for 55 
Package has resulted in a rising carbon price, which exceeded 
€80/tCO2 in December 2023 (Montel and Ember, 2024).

Iberdrola (2023f, pp. 1, 87), Enel (2023a, p.86)

Three out of the five companies assessed in our analysis — Duke Energy, ENGIE, and KEPCO 
— consider resorting to false solutions like CC(U)S or bioenergy (KEPCO, 2022, p. 59,69,76; 
Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 37,44; ENGIE, 2023, p. 66,98). The reliance on CCUS in electricity 
generation faces severe risks due to the unproven efficacy and potential environmental impacts 
of these technologies. Furthermore, CCUS is not yet available at scale and may come at a high 
cost compared to switching to renewables (Grant et al., 2021). Duke Energy is also exploring 
decarbonising its scope 3 downstream by tapping into renewable natural gas (RNG) from 
waste-based feedstocks (Duke Energy, 2023b, p. 31). Similarly, ENGIE considers the role of 
(decarbonised) gas like biomethane from non-recyclable waste crucial for its transformation. 
However, their approach to heavy bioenergy reliance potentially overlooks the fuel’s negative 
sustainability implications and distracts the company from investing in renewable generation 
and supporting electrification in end-use sectors, while prolonging the use of existing fossil 
gas infrastructure (Saadat et al., 2020).

Table 11: Fossil fuel phase out commitments for electric utilities

In the automotive and fashion sectors, commitments on phasing out fossil 
fuel are mostly missing or insufficient.

Four of the five automotive manufacturers assessed do not set phase-out dates for internal 
combustion engines (ICE), which the automotive sector sees as a critical transitional measure. 
Daimler Trucks is the only company assessed that commits to 100% zero-emissions vehicles 
worldwide; the heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer aims to reach this milestone in the EU, Japan, 
and US by 2039, and in the rest of the world by 2050 (Daimler Truck, 2023a, pp. 78, 81). While 
the other four companies set carbon neutrality or net-zero targets, they do not communicate 
phase-out dates for ICEs on all of their markets (see section 2.1). However, the global sales 
share for zero-emission light-duty vehicles must reach 100% between 2035–2040 and earlier 
in advanced economies (CAT, 2020, p. 27; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 
93), meaning that ICE sales must be completely phased out by the end of next decade (COP26 
Presidency, 2021; SBTi, 2023a, pp. 4–6). A complete phase-out of ICE trucks would need to 
be achieved between 2045–2050 globally (Boehm et al., 2023; IEA, 2023c).

The fashion companies in our assessment are taking measures to decrease the use of coal in 
their supply chain but only three committed to a coal phase-out in the production process. 
Adidas, Nike, and Inditex committed to eliminate coal from the production processes of their 
materials (tier 2) and finished goods (tier 1) suppliers. Adidas’ claims that its suppliers have 
not installed any new coal-fired boilers, heaters, or power generation system since 2022 and 
commits to phasing out coal-fired boilers at all finished goods and materials suppliers by 2025 
(Adidas, 2024, p. 86). Nike supported its finished goods suppliers in replacing coal-fired steam 
boilers with electric alternatives in recent years and pledged to eliminate coal from finished 
goods and material suppliers by 2030 (Nike, 2023, p. 100). Inditex pledged to eliminate the use 
of coal in their supply chain (tier 1 and tier 2) and to avoid installing new coal-fired equipment 
from 2023 (Inditex, 2023a). The two other companies – H&M Group and Fast Retailing – do 
not commit to phase out coal in the production processes within their supply chains. H&M 
Group states that it will no longer onboard new suppliers that have on-site coal boilers but has 
not yet presented a timeline for completely phasing out coal in their supply chain (H&M Group, 
2023d, p. 26). Fast Retailing merely commits to “leverage our long-standing partnerships to 
promote measures that will […] phase out coal and introduce renewable energy at major partner 
factories” (Fast Retailing, 2023b, p. 56).

Fashion companies’ plans to expand biomass use in the supply chain could undermine their 
commitments to decrease or phase out coal. All five fashion companies assessed use biomass 
in their supply chain (see section 3.3). Notably, H&M Group presents biomass as a solution to 
reduce emissions in the supply chain. The Swedish fashion company states that “certain types 
of biomass can act as a stop-gap solution” for suppliers who have no access to non-combustible 
renewable energy sources and are connected to unreliable electricity grids (H&M Group, 2023a). 
However, biomass has severe sustainability implications and is therefore not a credible solution 
for reducing coal reliance. Section 3.3 discusses this issue in more detail.

39Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Recommendations for scaling up the rate of corporate fossil fuel phase-out commitments
	� Regulators should enact policies that accelerate the fossil fuel phase-out in the power, 
fashion, and automotive sectors.

	� Companies should considerably scale up commitments and present a clear timeline on 
fossil fuel phase-out. These should systematically be included in companies’ transition 
plans and published in the sustainability report.

	� Standard setters and voluntary initiatives should formulate more prescriptive 
corporate guidelines requiring companies to include fossil fuel phase-out requirements 
in their transition plans. For instance, fashion companies should be mandated to 
present a timeline for phasing out coal in their supply chain, while car manufacturers 
should be mandated to present a timeline for phasing out internal combustion engines.

3.2 Renewable electricity procurement: innovative leadership and cheap claims
Some extracts of this section are adapted from a special edition of the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor focused on renewable 
electricity strategies (Mooldijk et al., 2024). The companies assessed in that report are included in the analysis within this section.

Summary

While corporate claims and targets for renewable electricity 
are increasing, the meaning and impact of these claims vary 
significantly. Standalone Renewable Energy Certificates 
(RECs) still play a large role in companies’ renewable electricity 
procurement strategies, but we see that companies are 
increasingly aware of the limitations of this approach and 
shifting towards higher quality procurement instruments. 
There is a rising momentum for hourly matching of renewable 
electricity, although more support and incentives are 
needed for companies to adopt this approach. We find 
that voluntary initiatives and standards currently offer 
limited incentives for companies to pursue higher quality 
renewable electricity strategies. The update process for the 
GHG Protocol’s guidance on Scope 2 emissions accounting 
presents a promising opportunity to realign the standards 
with transparent and ambitious practices.

Corporate renewable electricity claims and targets 
are increasing, but all mean different things and 
their real impact is often far less than implied.

Of the 22 companies4 included in Table 12, seven companies 
made some form of 100% renewable electricity claims in 2022, 
while around half claimed to procure most of their electricity 
from renewable sources. The RE100 initiative found that 
its members consumed 50% renewable electricity in 2022 
(RE100, 2024), up from 45% in 2020 (RE100, 2023). 

While renewable electricity claims are increasing among 
companies, it is not easy to understand what these claims 
mean. The landscape of renewable electricity procurement 
constructs from these companies is highly nuanced due to the 
differences in the coverage of targets, procurement constructs 
and the methods for matching renewable generation with 
consumption (Figure 5), making it difficult to compare the 
claims directly. Companies investing in higher-quality strategies 
such as PPAs or utility tariffs with hourly matching are often 
grouped with those pursuing more accessible claims with 
limited impact, such as the procurement of standalone RECs 
with annual matching. Because of the limitations of all these 
approaches, GHG emissions associated with companies’ 
electricity consumption are often significantly misrepresented.

 

4    Our analysis of renewable electricity procurement excludes electric utilities, but includes the companies covered by the report Navigating the nuances of 
corporate renewable electricity procurement (Mooldijk et al., 2024).

Despite their limitations, standalone RECs still 
play a large role in companies’ strategies for 
procuring renewable electricity today.

Of the 22 companies included in Table 12, at least 16 use 
standalone RECs to account for a significant proportion of 
their renewable electricity claims. For at least 11 of these 
companies, standalone RECs constitute the main method for 
claiming to procure renewable electricity.

In many cases, this involves the purchase of RECs that may 
not originate from the same region as where the companies 
operate. For instance, lululemon procured RECs from Germany 
to cover its electricity consumption across all EU countries 
where the company operates (lululemon, 2023). Similarly, 
H&M Group bought RECs from Norway to cover electricity 
consumption in its stores in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, and 
Spain, among others (H&M Group, 2023b). Although the 
European grid is interconnected, the physical flow of electricity 
from one country to another is much smaller than the number 
of RECs traded between countries (Hamburger, 2023). 
Purchasing Norwegian RECs does not signal demand to the 
Bulgarian electricity market and carries the risk of implicit 
double counting, where both the REC buyer and Norwegian 
grid consumers believe they are using renewable electricity.

Several companies, including H&M Group, Inditex, lululemon, 
TSMC and Volkswagen, indicate their intention to transition 
to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in the coming years, 
although all these companies currently purchase standalone 
RECs to cover most of their renewable electricity claims. 
H&M Group has recently signed PPAs in Spain, Sweden and 
the United Kingdom, which may account for about a third of 
the company’s current electricity demand once operational 
(H&M Group, 2023a).

We also see signs that PPAs overtaking standalone RECs as 
the preferred procurement method in emerging renewable 
electricity markets. For example, while Samsung and TSMC 
could have purchased standalone RECs for their operations 
in South Korea and Taiwan, respectively, neither company 
has pursued this option; now that PPAs are possible in 
these  countries, Samsung and TSMC show signs of starting 
to procure renewable electricity through this approach 
(Mooldijk et al., 2024).

There are also promising signs that some companies are looking 
for more innovative solutions to overcome the burdens and 
complexities associated with directly engaging in PPAs, which 
could increase access to high-quality procurement constructs 
for other companies with more limited resources. For example, 
Google and Apple have collaborated with several regional 
utilities to establish utility-scale programmes through which 
companies can sign long-term contracts with the utility to 
manage a portfolio of PPA-style constructs. Gap and TSMC 
have pursued aggregated PPA constructs, which allows 
companies to pool their resources and expertise to develop 
high- quality plans (Mooldijk et al., 2024).

There is growing momentum for matching 
renewable electricity generation with 
consumption on an hourly basis, but replication 
requires support and incentives.

Some companies – including Google and Microsoft – have 
recognised the limitations of annual matching and are moving 
to hourly (24/7) matching (Day, Mooldijk, Hans, et al., 2023; 
Mooldijk et al., 2024). Emerging scientific literature on hourly 
matching clearly demonstrates that its potential to address the 
challenges of the electricity system and ultimately decrease 
emissions is significantly greater compared to annual matching. 
Annual renewable electricity matching hides a significant 
embedded reliance on fossil fuel generation. Companies that 
commit to match their electricity consumption on an hourly 
basis provide a critical demand pull for additional and novel 
renewable energy generation and storage technologies that 
will be necessary to completely decarbonise power systems 
in the most challenging times and locations.

Across the companies discussed in section B of this report, 
only Daimler Truck claims to be procuring electricity using a 
24/7 accounting method for its production sites in Europe 
(Daimler Truck, 2023a, p. 94). However, the company provides 
very little information on what this approach entails, making 
it difficult for us to assess the integrity of this claim. As of 
March 2024, the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact had 147 
(24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact, 2024), but most of 
these entities were either tech companies, power companies, 
research groups, or consultancies. This indicates that systems 
for 24/7 procurement are still in a phase of development and 
may not yet be accessible for every company to implement. 

While it might not be realistic for companies to switch to 24/7 
accounting overnight, major companies could already commit 
to transitioning towards this accounting metric in the coming 
years. To this end, it is critical that major initiatives responsible 
for accounting guidelines and seeking to mobilise corporate 
renewable electricity targets – such as the GHG Protocol and 
the RE100 initiative – integrate 24/7 accounting into their 
guidance. Companies that currently strive to replicate this good 
practice approach may find themselves outside the guidelines 
of these initiatives, potentially without support and recognition.

Voluntary initiatives and standards currently 
provide limited guidance incentives for 
companies to strive for emerging best practice in 
high-quality renewable electricity procurement.

Companies’ climate strategies – and the integrity of their 
leadership credentials – are dependent on high-quality 
guidelines, standards, and criteria from major international 
cooperative initiatives and certification schemes. But the most 
relevant and influential initiatives largely fail to distinguish 
between the nuanced aspects of renewable electricity 
accounting (Mooldijk et al., 2024). While the tools developed 
by the GHG Protocol, RE100, SBTi, and the CDP may have 
promoted awareness of corporate renewable electricity 
procurement at the point of their design, the level of detail 
and differentiation no longer adequately reflect the complexity 
of corporate renewable electricity strategies that we see from 
major companies today: 

	� Neither the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Standard, the RE100 
technical criteria, nor the SBTi Net Zero Standard 
distinguish between procurement constructs such as 
standalone RECs, PPAs, and utility-scale tariffs.

� None of the major initiatives distinguish between annual 
and hourly approaches for matching renewable electricity.

� None of the major initiatives provide guidance or specific 
criteria for accounting for the procurement of renewable 
electricity in the supply chain, which is the most relevant 
source of electricity demand for many companies.

Table 12 indicates that – for the companies covered by our 
analysis – neither the GHG Protocol accounting methodologies 
nor the RE100 membership criteria offer clear and consistent 
differentiation between companies that demonstrate real 
leadership for high-quality renewable electricity strategies 
and those pursuing much lower-quality approaches.

Our assessments of Google and Microsoft in our separate 
renewable electricity focus report (Mooldijk et al., 2024) 
explain how the undifferentiated standards of these initiatives 
may even pose a barrier for companies to adopt emerging 

44Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



best practices, due to comparative disadvantages. Some 
companies like Inditex, lululemon, Tesco and Samsung in 
some regions, are reporting 100% renewable electricity under 
the minimum criteria of the mainstreamed standards, using 
annual matching and mostly standalone RECs. Companies 
that strive for higher-quality PPAs like Gap, Nike or Walmart, 
and companies who pursue 24/7 matching like Google and 
Microsoft, are only able to report comparatively lower shares 
of renewable electricity, although their renewable electricity 
strategies are more constructive and likely to have a greater 
impact in reducing emissions. Given the significant influence 
of these initiatives, the revision of their guidelines and criteria 
to facilitate such a differentiation may represent one of the 
most promising and necessary levers for raising the ambition 
of companies’ renewable electricity strategies.

The GHG Protocol began a major revision period in 2023, 
aiming to publish updated standards to be published in 
2026 (GHG Protocol, 2023). After initial consultations, the 
GHG Protocol published its Summary of Proposal Submissions 
Related to Scope 2 Guidance in December 2023 (WRI and 
WBCSD, 2023), to be reviewed  by a technical working group 
throughout 2024 and 2025. 

This summary of proposals includes some promising 
elements; in particular, the following proposals would be 
of key importance:

	� Increasing granularity of renewable electricity matching 
in time and location, including a switch to hourly 
matching instead of annual matching. 

	� Increasing the stringency of additionality requirements 
for renewable electricity procurement constructs. 
Options explicitly mentioned for consideration include 
restrictions on the use of unbundled electricity 
products, which would include standalone RECs. 

However, the summary of proposals also includes some 
elements that could represent a considerable step back for 
transparency and integrity. 

	� The proposal to introduce a new accounting method 
– labelled ‘project-based accounting’ – would allow 
companies to claim reductions in their scope 2 emissions 
based on emissions avoided from renewable energy 
projects implemented anywhere in the world, whether 
inside or outside of the local grid region or market. This 
proposal appears closely aligned with the Emissions First 
Partnership, initiated by Amazon and with a small group 
of corporate signatories that includes Meta, Intel, and 
General Motors. In practice, this would effectively be the 
same as offsetting with carbon credits, which is a highly 
contentious proposal for improving the Scope 2 Guidance. 

The extent to which GHG Protocol and other major initiatives 
can foster and accelerate the implementation of higher-quality 
corporate renewable electricity strategies will largely depend 
on the decisions made on these three key proposals. Until the 
publication of the updated standards in 2026, other influential 
initiatives for corporate renewable electricity procurement, 
such as RE100, should not wait to align their own guidance and 
criteria with emerging good practices, recognising the urgency 
for accelerated action on renewable electricity deployment.

Recommendations for the revision of guidelines and criteria of major initiatives to distinguish 
between highly significant nuances in corporate renewable electricity strategies

GHG Protocol & RE100: We recommend that the major initiatives adopt a common standard 
for renewable electricity claims and revise the market-based emission accounting method to 
differentiate between highly significant nuances in renewable electricity strategies. This means:

	� Count only meaningful renewable electricity procurement constructs; RECs should be 
understood only as a supplementary accounting tool unless evidence is provided to 
demonstrate its effectiveness as a standalone procurement construct.

	� Count only renewable electricity generated on the same grid as the electricity 
consumption it is matched to.

	� Distinguish between annual and hourly accounting methods, with a transition towards 
hourly matching as the standard approach as soon as practically possible.

	� Provide guidance and criteria on setting supply chain targets and strategies.

 

The update process for the GHG Protocol’s guidance on Scope 2 emissions accounting presents a promising 
opportunity to realign the standard with transparent and ambitious practices.

3.3 Bioenergy: reliance on unsustainable solutions

Summary

While over half of the companies assessed consider bioenergy 
in their decarbonisation plans, it is not a credible solution 
for any of them. Particularly in the fashion sector, plans for 
switching coal to biomass in the supply chain may significantly 
undermine seemingly ambitious emission reduction targets 
– and in some cases render them meaningless. Contrary to 
popular belief, bioenergy is not an emissions-free energy 
source, and sourcing biomass is likely to have negative 
impacts on ecosystems and local communities. Companies 
that consider themselves climate leaders should refrain from 
using bioenergy and instead advocate for policy changes in 
regions where sourcing bioenergy is easier and cheaper than 
sourcing non-combustible sources of renewable energy.

Companies present bioenergy as part of their emission 
reduction plans, but in most cases, it is not a credible measure, 
given that bioenergy is likely to have a range of negative 
sustainability implications. Over half of the 20 companies 
assessed use bioenergy in their own operations or their value 
chain, including all five fashion companies, Stellantis, Toyota, 
Volvo, and Duke Energy. However, bioenergy is very likely to 
have negative sustainability implications. These include, but 
are not limited to, deforestation, biodiversity loss and food 
insecurity (Kline et al., 2015; Hof et al., 2018; Searchinger et 
al., 2018; Calvin et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2021; Clarke et al., 
2022; Hanssen et al., 2022).

Bioenergy is not an emissions-free energy source. Cutting 
down trees or other plants and burning them to generate 
energy leads to the release of sequestered carbon. It can take 
several to hundreds of years to balance out this release of 
CO2, depending on the type of trees used (Holsmark, 2012; 
Mitchell et al., 2012; Ter-Mikaelian et al., 2015; Searchinger 
et al., 2018). Land used to grow bioenergy crops cannot 
be used for other purposes, such as directly sequestering 

carbon (Searchinger et al., 2022). This carbon opportunity 
cost of land should be factored in when calculating the net 
impact of bioenergy. While advanced bioenergy may play a 
minor role in decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors, such as 
aviation, the sectors assessed in this report have sufficient 
alternatives to decarbonise their value chains (Calvin et al., 
2020; Clarke et al., 2022).

Bioenergy is a scarce resource, which means companies 
using truly sustainable bioenergy push others to use non-
sustainable bioenergy. Most of the companies assessed in 
this report claim to use “sustainable” bioenergy. Although it 
is commendable that companies set sustainability criteria for 
the bioenergy that they source, using any type of bioenergy 
at all, which is and will remain a scarce resource, inherently 
pushes other companies to use non-sustainable biomass.

Companies in the power, automotive and fashion 
sector use biomass to replace fossil fuels, but 
these sectors can achieve full decarbonisation 
using non-combustible renewable energy sources. 

Biomass to replace fossil fuels remains a common measure 
among electric utilities, but is not a credible alternative to 
ramping on renewable deployment. Of the five electric utilities 
assessed, Duke Energy and ENGIE have plans for significant 
biogas sales (Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 56; ENGIE, 2023, p. 
11). Duke Energy plans to replace its fossil gas sales with 
“renewable natural gas” (RNG) and a relatively small share of 
hydrogen (Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 56). While RNG is mainly 
sourced from landfills, wastewater, food waste, and animal 
manure, Duke Energy expects energy crops to become the key 
resource to produce RNG by 2050 (Duke Energy, 2023a, pp. 
53–54). We did not identify further details on where and how 
these energy crops would be produced, but they are very likely 
to compete with food production or ecosystem preservation 
(Kline et al., 2015; Hof et al., 2018; Calvin et al., 2020; Ahmed 
et al., 2021; Clarke et al., 2022; Hanssen et al., 2022). ENGIE 
considers biomethane from agricultural and food waste a key 

solution to decarbonise its gas sales, alongside renewable 
hydrogen and fossil gas with CCUS (ENGIE, 2023, p. 33), The 
French utility plans to produce 10TWh of biomethane per year 
in Europe by 2030, up from its current capacity of 8.3TWh 
(ENGIE, 2023, p. 11,30). While there may be some scope for 
producing biomethane from agricultural waste for sectors 
that are hard to electrify, most end-consumers can electrify 
or switch to green hydrogen (Calvin et al., 2020; Clarke et al., 
2022). Marketing biomethane as an emissions-free option risks 
exacerbating sustainability issues and delaying investments in 
non-combustible sources of renewable energy.

Although the five companies assessed in this report do 
not significantly invest in biomass for electricity and heat 
generation, various other electricity utilities pursue this option, 
including EON, RWE, Uniper, and Vattenfall for their European 
operations (Mooldijk et al., 2022; RWE, 2024; Vattenfall, 2024) 
For instance, RWE co-fires biomass in its Dutch power plants, 
and Vattenfall operates a combined heat and power plant 
exclusively fuelled by biomass. However, as discussed above, 
bioenergy is not an emissions-free source. Electric utilities that 
pursue bioenergy for electricity and heat generation contribute 
– directly or indirectly - to a range of sustainability problems. 
As Iberdrola and Enel show, non-combustible sources of 
renewable energy, like solar, wind, and geothermal, are 
economically attractive (see section 2.1). Further investments 
in these sources are necessary to decarbonise the energy 
system within the next decades.

Fashion companies are supporting suppliers to switch to 
biomass, but this is not a credible alternative to electrification 
and renewable electricity. All five fashion companies in this 
assessment work with suppliers who use biomass to generate 
on-site heat and steam (Zhang, 2023). For example, H&M Group 
pursues biomass as a key decarbonisation measure in the short 
term. In its sustainability disclosure in 2021, the company aimed 
for Cambodia to become the first production country to use 100% 
biomass boilers (H&M Group, 2022, p. 24). While such targets 
are missing from its latest sustainability disclosure, supporting 

46Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



suppliers to transition to “thermal energy from agriculture 
residues” (i.e. biomass) is still listed as a key reduction measure 
(H&M Group, 2023d, p. 28). On its Climate webpage, H&M 
Group states that “certain types of biomass can act as a 
stop-gap solution” for suppliers who have no access to non-
combustible renewable energy sources and are connected to 
unreliable electricity grids (H&M Group, 2023a). Adidas and 
Inditex also state that they encourage their suppliers to switch 
to biomass (Inditex, 2023a, p. 205; Adidas, 2024, p. 87).  We 
could not identify any information on the use of biomass in 
the supply chain in Nike’s and Fast Retailing’s sustainability 
reports, but research by Stand.earth has shown that several 
of these companies’ suppliers use biomass for generating heat 
and steam (Zhang, 2023).

While fashion brands need to phase out coal in their supply 
chains, replacing it with biomass may distract from energy 
efficiency improvements and investments in electrification 
and novel technologies for generating heat and steam, such 
as green hydrogen and concentrated solar (Ley et al., 2021, p. 
21). As those options are not yet viable at commercial scale, 
large investments are needed to unlock their decarbonisation 
potential. In addition, a key emission reduction measure that 
companies can take in the short term is switching to dry 
processing (tier 2) (Ley et al., 2021, p. 6) This can decrease 
energy use by around 80%.

It is critical that fashion brands lobby with national governments 
for a policy environment that is conducive to renewable energy 
generation and consumption. In many key manufacturing 
countries, regulatory policies hinder the transition to non-
combustible renewable energy sources and incentivise the 
use of wood for heat and steam production. In Cambodia, for 
instance, factories are not allowed to generate more than 50% 
of their electricity demand on site (Flynn and Ball, 2023). Also, 
wood is cheaper than (renewable) electricity in Cambodia, 
which makes it economically attractive to use biomass instead 
of investing in electrification.

Biofuels remain a focal point in the automotive industry 
but are not a credible alternative to electrification. Three 
of the five automotive manufacturers assessed – Stellantis, 
Toyota and Volvo Group – invest in biofuels alongside 
their electrification efforts. For instance, Stellantis deploys 
bioethanol-compatible vehicles in the Brazilian market and is 
set to launch an electric-bioethanol hybrid vehicle model in 
2024 (Lara, 2023; Stellantis, 2023a, p. 87). Volvo Group states 
its intention to produce ICE trucks with “sustainable fuels”, 
including biofuels (Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 16, 155, 2023b). 
However, road transport – including heavy duty vehicles - can 
fully electrify, using battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel 
cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) (Molliere, 2022; Tol et al., 2022; 
T&E, 2023). BEVs and FCECs are proven technologies and 
rapidly improving, which means that negative side effects 
associated with the mining of critical minerals can be mitigated. 
Automotive manufacturers that continue to invest in biofuels 
or synthetic fuels risk delaying the phase-out of vehicles with 
internal combustion engines.

Despite scientific evidence indicating that bioenergy is not 
carbon neutral and poses a range of other sustainable issues, 
the IEA and national governments classify bioenergy as a 
renewable energy source, placing it on par with wind and 
solar. The International Energy Agency (IEA) considers “modern 
bioenergy”, which excludes biomass used for cooking and 
heating with open fires or simple stoves, as an import source 
of renewable energy (IEA, 2024). The IEA Net Zero scenario 
forecasts an annual increase of 8% in the use of modern 
bioenergy for energy generation between 2022 and 2030 
and a doubling of biomass use for electricity generation in the 
same period (IEA, 2023c, 2024). The IPCC guidelines state 
that countries should report emissions from bioenergy in the 
Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector 
rather than in the energy sector (IPCC, 2019). This creates a 
perverse incentive for countries to import and burn biomass 
for energy generation because they are allowed to report 
zero emissions from energy generation. It may explain why 
certain countries provide substantial subsidies for bioenergy 
generation. The European Renewable Energy Directive 
considers bioenergy a renewable energy source and various 
member states encourage electric utilities to co-fire woody 
biomass in power installations (European Parliament and the 

Council of the European Union, 2023b). Bioenergy accounts 
for over half of the renewable electricity generation in the EU 
(European Commission, 2023), which implies that the actual 
reduction of CO2 emissions from energy generation is less than 
what the EU claims it to be. Biomass also plays a key role in 
the UK Government’s energy policy and aspirations to achieve 
net zero emissions by 2050 (Department for Energy Security 
& Net Zero, 2023). The Drax power plant in North Yorkshire is 
the UK’s largest power plant and the world’s largest biomass 
installation, with an annual generation of 14 terawatt-hours 
(TWh) (Drax, 2024).

47Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Recommendations for avoiding an unsustainable reliance on biomass in corporate climate strategies

Companies: Companies should take the following measures to avoid negative sustainability 
implications from the use of bioenergy: 

	� Phase out bioenergy if alternatives exist or will likely become available in the near future.

	� For sectors that will rely on bioenergy to some extent (e.g. aviation), present a very clear 
plan of criteria to source bioenergy and ensure that negative impacts are minimised.

	� Advocate for policy changes to ensure that (renewable) electricity is more economically 
attractive than biomass.

 
Voluntary initiatives: To provide companies with better guidance on the use and avoidance of 
bioenergy, voluntary initiatives should:

	� Develop corporate guidance to account for emissions from bioenergy.

	� Explicitly exclude bioenergy from the list of “renewable energy” sources.

	� Require companies to commit to switching to non-combustible renewable energy sources 
(e.g. wind, solar, geothermal).

 

Regulators: Due to existing regulations, companies get a perverse incentive to switch to 
bioenergy instead of non-combustible sources of renewable energy. Regulators should:

	� Not label bioenergy as a sustainable renewable energy source on par with non-
combustible renewable energy sources energy (e.g. wind, solar, geothermal).

	� Remove regulatory hurdles to the procurement of non-combustible sources of 
renewable energy (e.g. wind, solar, geothermal).

 
IEA and IPCC: Should reconsider the labelling of and accounting rules for bioenergy, as the 
current terminology and labelling provide countries and companies with a perverse incentive 
to prioritise bioenergy over non-combustible renewable energy sources.

3.4 Offsetting 2.0? Agrifood companies’ use of land sequestration CDR in the value chain

Summary

Carbon dioxide removals (CDR) are crucial to reach net-zero 
emissions globally by mid-century. In the food and agriculture 
sector, land sequestration CDR measures can contribute 
not only to climate change mitigation but can also support 
biodiversity and reduce reliance on chemical inputs and 
pesticides. However, companies in the food and agriculture 
sector are currently counting on land sequestration carbon 
dioxide removals within their value chain to meet significant 
portions of their emission reduction targets, sometimes 
referred to as ‘insetting’. Besides major uncertainties around 
the permanence and potential of land sequestration CDR, the 
aggregation of removals and emission reductions is hiding 
a lack of commitment and progress towards the necessary 
agricultural transitions for reducing emissions from highly 
challenging sources.  As a first step towards addressing the 
existing ambiguity, companies could set emission reduction 
targets for specific agricultural emission sources, if it is not yet 
feasible for companies to completely disaggregate removals 
from emission reductions for all agricultural sub-sectors. 
Organisations developing benchmarks, target validators and 
standard setters can contribute to this practice by providing 
additional guidance covering emission reduction requirements 
for specific agricultural emission sources.

Is the term ‘insetting’ on the way out? Fewer companies refer 
to the buzzword in their climate strategies, but the same 
practices persist under different descriptions. ‘Insetting’ is 
a business-driven concept and refers to offsetting within the 
value chain. The term ‘insetting’ is predominantly used in the 
food and agriculture sector, mainly involving land sequestration 
carbon dioxide removals (CDR) within the value chain. Food 
and agriculture companies assessed in this iteration of the 
CCRM no longer refer to the term ‘insetting’, but describe 
the same practices using different terms. For instance, Nestlé 
refers to "carbon scope 3 removals" (Nestlé, 2023b, p. 44).

Enhanced land sequestration CDR is crucial for reaching 
global temperature targets, especially in the food sector…

There are clear signs that land sequestration CDR is becoming 
an increasingly key strategy in the food and agriculture sector. 
Four of the five assessed food and agriculture companies 
mention some form of land sequestration CDR in their climate 
strategy, with some companies making these measures a 
central component. The mitigation potential and feasibility 
of land sequestration CDR measures remain uncertain, but 
they can significantly contribute to mitigating emissions (Costa 
et al., 2022; Boehm et al., 2023, p. 126). In 1.5°C-aligned 
pathways, global residual emissions mainly persist in the food 
and agriculture sector since reducing agricultural emissions 
– in particular methane and nitrous oxide – to zero is not 
feasible with currently available technologies and practices. 
Therefore, CDR will play an important role – on a global scale 
– to balance out the significant residual emissions from the 
sector. However, the required ratio of emission reductions 
versus removals in companies’ climate strategies remains 
uncertain. In addition to removing carbon dioxide, practices 
related to land sequestration CDR in the agriculture sector can 
increase biodiversity and reduce reliance on chemical inputs 
and pesticides while maintaining agricultural productivity in 
a changing climate (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 126). 

…but, in parallel to enhancing CDR practices, food and agriculture 
companies need to pursue sectoral transitions to achieve deep 
emission reductions. While the increased attention on CDR 
measures is a positive development, they should not be seen as 
an alternative to emission reductions that must also be achieved 
and require a more fundamental and carefully planned transition. 
Although residual emissions in the sector will mainly consist of 
methane and nitrous oxide, the volume of those GHGs also 
still need to reduce drastically and rapidly. We find that some 
companies in the food and agriculture sector treat emission 
reductions and land sequestration CDR within the value chain 
interchangeably in their plans for meeting targets, making their 
targets incomparable (see Table 13). From most of the companies we 
assess, we see limited signs of measures that can lead to significant 
emission reductions in the sector: the practice of aggregating 

removals with emissions can obscure the lack of progress in 
the agriculture transition, especially with regards to reducing 
methane from livestock and nitrous oxide emissions from 
fertilisers, which are some of the most important yet challenging 
emission sources for the sector to address. Land sequestration 
CDR is not comparable to emission reductions from a climate 
perspective. Land sequestration CDR is associated with no 
to limited permanence: there is a very high likelihood of re-
release of the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere within years 
or decades (Deprez et al., 2024). For example, lands could be 
mismanaged, and forests can be subject to wildfires. For CDR to 
effectively substitute emission reductions, carbon storage must 
be guaranteed for centuries (Wang et al., 2023). Agricultural 
emissions also need to be significantly reduced in the decade 
of critical climate action: land sequestration CDR needs to 
happen in addition to deep emission reductions. 

Despite the shortcomings described above, the Science-Based 
Targets initiative’s (SBTi) Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) 
guidance allows for an undefined and potentially substantial 
role of land sequestration in achieving emission reduction 
targets. SBTi's FLAG guidance describes that removals on land 
owned or operated by a company or within a company's value 
chain can count toward achieving a FLAG target (SBTi, 2023b, 
p. 34), but does not specify to what extent. Although the FLAG 
guidance states that historical emissions and removals need 
to be reported separately, it does not call for separate targets. 
Neither the SBTi FLAG guidance nor SBTi’s Net Zero Standard 
specifies the share of land sequestration CDR allowed for 
emission reduction targets. 

Separate emission reduction and emission removal targets 
would significantly increase transparency and reduce 
ambiguity of food and agriculture companies’ climate 
strategies; benchmarks for the food and agriculture sector 
should also call for a clear distinction between these targets. 
The food and agriculture sector is one of the sectors with 
significant residual emissions by mid-century in the global 
1.5°C-aligned emission pathways, and CDR from land 

49Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



sequestration are pivotal in achieving net-zero and eventually 
net-negative emissions. However, food and agriculture 
companies, as well as some existing sectoral benchmarks, 
currently do not set out a transparent vision for the role of 
emission reductions vis-à-vis removals in the sector. Further 
research is required to clarify what appropriate pathways 
would be and how to account for them. Ultimately, food and 
agriculture companies’ targets would become substantially 
more informative and constructive with the clear separation 
of emission removals from emission reductions. 

Additional emission reduction targets for some specific 
agricultural emission sources could help alleviate the ambiguity 
of targets, especially if it is not yet feasible for companies to 
completely disaggregate removals from emission reductions 
for all agricultural sub-sectors. With the current state of 
reporting guidance, measurement tools and protocols, as well 
as scientific benchmarks covering food and agriculture and 

land sequestration CDR, it is indeed challenging to separate 
the removals from reductions in emissions accounting in some 
agricultural subsectors. However, there are also highly significant 
agricultural emission sources for which this disaggregation 
is possible. If it is not yet feasible to require companies to 
set separate FLAG targets for removals and emissions, target 
validators and standard setters could ask companies set 
additional emission reduction commitments for specific emission 
sources where possible and highly relevant. For example, in 
addition to its overarching FLAG target, Danone has set an 
additional and more specific target for reducing methane 
emissions from fresh milk (see Danone, p.118). Ultimately, such 
additions would clarify the meaning of companies’ overarching 
targets and guide the sector into a more fundamental transition, 
which requires deep emission reductions and – for some 
emission sources – fundamental changes to the business model.

Insetting – or land sequestration CDR within the value chain 
– often resembles offsetting practices, but with fewer control 
mechanisms. In addition to the previously mentioned concerns, 
insetting practices often represent a mixed bag of activities 
that can range from being genuinely within the value chain 
to resembling offsetting practices. Improved soil treatment to 
enhance carbon sequestration of agricultural land would be an 
example of CDR within the value chain. But companies also, for 
example, may engage in activities like tree planting in proximity 
to crop production. Although this measure takes place close to 
the value chain activities and related measures, it can be viewed 
as offsetting due to uncertain link to the actual value chain. In 
addition, there is a lack of control mechanisms for insetting in 
place. In many cases, it remains unclear who is responsible for 
the quality control, accounting, and external validation.

Recommendations for disaggregating CDR and emission reductions in agriculture 

Recognising that carbon dioxide removals are not an equivalent substitute for the reduction of agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions but rather an important additional objective: 

	� Benchmarks, standards and guidance (e.g. SBTi FLAG guidance): The existing 
benchmarks and guidance documents for the food and agriculture sector need to call 
for separate emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal targets. Realising the 
accounting tools and mechanisms are highly limited and pose a significant challenge 
to this, a first step towards separating removals from reductions would be to require 
additional emission reduction targets for specific emission sources. Guidance documents 
and benchmarks should emphasise the need for emission reductions, underlining the 
necessity for the agricultural transition.  

	� Food and agriculture companies should set clear emission reduction targets and specify 
what share of their net-zero targets will be realised with removals versus reductions, 
communicating transparently about the challenges the sector faces, including the 
relatively high volume of residual emissions.

3.5 Neutralising residual emissions: allocation of scarce carbon dioxide removal potential

Summary

Companies’ reliance on carbon dioxide removals to fulfil 
their net-zero targets is too high compared to what their 
residual emissions should be. Furthermore, they mostly 
rely on land sequestration CDR, which carries a high risk 
of non-permanence. High-quality CDR is a scarce resource, 
which means that a strict definition of residual emissions is 
needed, ideally at regulatory level or within existing corporate 
guidelines. Separate targets for emission reduction and carbon 
dioxide removal could offer a more credible and constructive 
approach compared to overarching net-zero targets.

Though transparency on the role of CDR in long-term strategies is often lacking, we observe that 
companies tend to excessively rely on them to achieve their climate neutrality targets. 

Out of the 37 companies listed in Table 14, 13 are transparent about their reliance on CDR technologies to achieve their net-zero 
target, while 24 do not report the share of CDR they rely on. For five companies, it is not clear whether they rely on CDR or not. 

For 12 out of the 13 companies that do report on CDR, we observe a high overall reliance, with CDR accounting for more than 9 
percent of their 2019 emissions. However, such reliance is deemed inappropriate due to scarcity and the risk of mitigation deterrence. 
Except for the agriculture sector, long-term targets across all sectors should reach 94% to 100% reductions (SBTi, 2023d, p. 28). 

Furthermore, land sequestration CDR is the most frequently type of CDR mentioned by companies (seven out of 10 reporting 
on the type of CDR they plan to use), although it faces significant challenges of non-permanence. Additionally, these plans for 
land sequestration CDR neutralisation are in addition to the biological neutralisation already included within the supply chain in 
the agriculture and land use sectors, mentioned in the previous section.

Table 14 indicates that there is no clear improvement in how companies communicate their neutralisation plans since the first 
CCRM two years ago.

Multiple issues related to the mitigation hierarchy, non-
permanence of carbon storage, scarcity of storage potential, 
and environmental damages require strict regulation of CDR 
by national governments. The mitigation hierarchy prioritises 
emissions reductions. Emissions reductions and removals 
are not equivalent (Zickfeld et al., 2021). Removals cannot 
reverse the effects of climate change caused by emissions, 
and even technical removals with a higher permanence are 
not equivalent to emissions not occurring in the first place, 
as they would need unachievably high liability guarantees and 
continued monitoring, reporting, verification (MRV).

The permanence of carbon dioxide removals must be 
guaranteed over a timeframe of centuries to millennia. The 
release of previously sequestered carbon negates any benefits 
of the sequestration: at the point at which the carbon dioxide 
is released, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide 
is restored to the same value that it would have been had the 
CDR activity never taken place. 

Scarce sustainable carbon dioxide removal potential must be 
reserved for balancing out residual emissions in sectors where 
the technical mitigation potential of existing technologies 
remains very limited, for it to remain possible to achieve 
global net-zero emissions. The challenges of permanence 
and scarcity are explained in more detail in section 4.1.3 of 
the Methodology Version 4.0 (NewClimate Institute, 2024).

The allocation of scarce CDR potential across companies is 
a challenging task, which is why CDR should be treated as a 
public good rather than something for companies to claim 
as their own. The allocation of scarce resources must align 
with global net- zero goals and adhere to a CDR hierarchy, 
rather than being on a first-come, first-served basis (Deprez 
et al., 2024). Ideally, governments would set separate targets 
for emissions reductions and CDR based on a very strict 
definition of residual emissions. They could then allocate the 
scarce CDR potential to sectors and companies in need, based 
on the CDR hierarchy and supported by rigorous MRV and 
liability requirements. We observe the emergence of legislation 

regarding the use of CDR, with requirements on CDR volumes 
to achieve net zero at the national level. For example, the 
proposal for the EU’s 2040 target by the EU Commission 
includes different scenarios on removals depending on the 
target level (European Commission, 2024, p. 6).

The key issue of scarcity is not well addressed in currently 
available guidelines for corporate climate target setting. 
Existing corporate guidelines like the Oxford Principles for Net 
Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting, the SBTi Corporate Net Zero 
Standard and the ISO Net Zero Guidelines, address the issue of 
demand for removals by defining residual emissions. The ISO 
standard defines them as GHGs that remain “after taking all 
possible actions” (ISO, 2022). The SBTi provides figures on long-
term science-based targets at sectoral level  (SBTi, 2023d, p. 28), 
showing varying demand for removals across sectors. However, 
none of the standards address the challenge of matching this 
demand with the supply of high-quality removals. There is no 
assessment regarding the scarcity of high-quality removals, and 
it remains unclear whether their definition of residual emissions 
or their assumptions about demand match with the actual 
supply. Corporate guidelines on net zero should address this 
challenge in the future, just as they are increasingly addressing 
the issue of permanence of removals.

Based on these issues, we conclude that it could only be 
credible for companies to complement their emissions 
reductions strategy with removals under specific conditions. 
This should be based on a strict definition of residual emissions 
and the use of only carbon dioxide removals with a high 
likelihood of sufficient permanence. Scarce potential and 
environmental damages mean that CDR measures cannot be 
considered a credible alternative to emissions reductions for 
emission sources that could feasibly be eliminated.

High-quality CDR is a scarce resource, which means that a strict definition of residual emissions is 
needed, ideally at regulatory level or, at the very least, within existing corporate guidelines.

54Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Separate emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal targets may be a 
more credible and constructive approach compared to net-zero targets.

We find that it is more credible for corporates to set three separate types of targets for emission 
reductions, land sequestration removals and industrial removals, without neutralisation 
claims. There is already extensive literature on the benefits of separate targets for emissions 
reductions and removals (McLaren et al., 2019). The separation approach applies to targets but 
also underlines the difference in timelines for emissions reductions (most urgent) and removals 
(needed for residual emissions at the end of a mitigation journey). The approach implies that 
a set of different policies and measures as well as MRV systems are needed for each of them, 
with the aim to increase environmental integrity.

Going further and splitting the target on removals into two different targets for permanent 
and for non-permanent removals is only a logical further step. This introduces different 
currencies on intrinsically different units, reinforces the mitigation hierarchy, and emphasises 
that counterbalancing emissions with removals entails different types of risks.

Removals are best financed by instruments other than the carbon markets, 
as these tend towards the cheapest options available.

The voluntary carbon markets are not the right instrument to channel funding for CDR. The 
integration of emission reductions and removals (with different degrees of permanence) into a 
single system means that removals are very likely to be used to offset emissions. This contradicts 
the principle that emission reductions and removals are not equivalent. Furthermore, carbon 
markets tend to invest in low-hanging fruits and cheap (low-quality) credits, whereas technical 
removals are one of the most expensive options existing today. The results of our analysis show 
that companies not only tend to overly rely on large volumes of CDR, but the majority of those 
which specify also rely on land sequestration CDR with high risks of non-permanence. On the 
voluntary carbon markets, these types of CDR are traded at much lower prices than other types 
of removals (Christie-Miller and Harvey, 2022). The supply of removals on these markets could 
be inflated by the lack of quality criteria, particularly on permanence, which would provide 
greater scope for emissions increase and delay emissions reductions.

Therefore, we find it is preferable to channel support for carbon dioxide removals through other 
instruments, for example, by implementing climate contributions, using auctioning revenues 
from existing carbon pricing mechanisms, establishing procurement schemes, or putting other 
obligations directly on companies (De Simone, Fabiola; Stoefs, 2023, p. 31).

Recommendations for the appropriate allocation of scarce CDR potential for neutralising residual emissions

	� Regulators and corporate guidelines on net zero should 
require companies to set three separate types of targets 
for emission reductions, land sequestration removals and 
industrial removals without neutralisation claims, and to 
report transparently on volumes and quality criteria set 
for biological and industrial removals.

	� Regulators and corporate guidelines on net zero 
should limit the concept of residual emissions to sectors 
where the technical mitigation potential of existing 
technologies remains very limited. They should also 
address the issue of scarcity of high-quality removals 
and include a scientific assessment on whether their 
assumptions on demand for removals match the supply. 

	� Companies should not source their removals through 
the voluntary carbon markets but through other 
instruments. If these instruments do not exist yet at 
national level, companies should advocate for the 
introduction of a robust scheme on removals that is 
compatible with global net zero.

Where next for corporate climate accountability?4
4.1 From carbon neutrality claims to more constructive climate contributions

Summary

As of 2023, only a minority of the companies assessed 
currently use carbon credits to make potentially misleading 
carbon neutrality claims, with some even moving away from 
such claims. European business consultancies and carbon 
credit sellers are also transitioning away from carbon neutrality 
labels. In the EU, legislators and advertising ombudsmen 
are ruling against carbon neutrality claims in the European 
Union, though similar developments have yet to materialise 
in other regions. Such developments significantly improve 
the transparency of companies’ climate communications. 
Climate contributions – finance provided by a company to 
support climate change action without claiming to neutralise 
its own emissions – may be a more constructive model to 
scale up voluntary climate finance. Despite this, only a small 
number of the companies in this report are contributing to 
climate change mitigation beyond their value chains without 
claiming neutralisation of emissions, and the volumes of 
support from these companies remain modest. New guidance 
including SBTi’s 2024 report on beyond value chain mitigation 
(BVCM) constitute concrete steps towards operationalising 
and mainstreaming climate contributions, but there remains 
a lack of specificity on the claims that companies can and 
cannot make based on the contributions they provide. In 2024, 
details on claim terminology and potential finance recipients 
need to be clarified to enable companies and consultancies 
to move forward with this approach.

Voluntary climate finance from corporates could significantly 
contribute to financing climate action where resources are 
limited, especially in developing countries. Historically, corporate 
climate finance has largely been generated through the voluntary 
carbon markets. In these markets, companies typically purchase 
carbon credits derived from emission reduction projects around 
the world to claim that their own emissions have been offset. 
But mechanisms for scaling up voluntary climate finance should 
not undermine transparency and incentives for companies 
to prioritise necessary measures for deep reductions in their 
own emissions. This section explores the signals that carbon 
neutrality claims may be on their way out and assesses progress 
in operationalising climate contributions as an alternative model 
to scale up voluntary climate finance.

The beginning of the end for unsubstantiated 
carbon neutrality claims?

Only a minority of the companies assessed currently claim 
that their businesses or specific products are carbon neutral, 
and some companies are moving away from such claims while 
continuing to contribute voluntary climate finance. Among 
the 20 companies assessed in section B of this report, only four 
– Daimler Truck, Danone, Mars and Volkswagen – reported in 
2022 or 2023 that certain products or aspects of their businesses 
were carbon neutral, achieved through the use of carbon credits. 
 
Table 15 shows why we have rated all of these claims to be 
of very poor or unclear integrity: each claim applies to only 
a fraction of the respective company’s emissions, and none 
of the companies provide evidence that the carbon credits 
they procure are of sufficiently high quality to be considered 
equivalent to reducing the company’s own emissions (see also 
Methodology section 4.1.2 regarding the limitations of carbon 
credits for offsetting claims).

The remaining 16 companies assessed in section B of this 
report did not make any form of carbon neutrality claim in 2022 
or 2023, although several of these companies have made such 
claims in the past. Nestlé announced in 2023 that it would 
move away from carbon neutrality claims based on offsets 
at the group and brand level (ESG Today, 2023), although 
the company indicates that some of its brands continue to 
purchase carbon credits for their “consumer engagement 
strategy”, without specifying the exact claims associated 
with those credits (Nestlé, 2023b, p. 41). Evian – a major 
brand of Danone – also announced in 2023 that it will not 
seek recertification of its carbon neutrality label after 2023 
(Evian, 2023), although Danone continues to make modest 
contributions to climate change mitigation beyond its value 
chain (see further details below). Nike, Stellantis, and Volvo 
Group previously procured carbon credits to make carbon 
neutrality claims but no longer make such claims. Other major 
companies such as easyJet and Gucci also publicly announced 
a move away from offsetting and carbon neutrality claims in 
2023 (Carbon Herald, 2023). Google and Microsoft – both of 
which received a poor rating for the integrity of their carbon 
neutrality claims in the 2023 Corporate Climate Responsibility 
Monitor – appear to be quietly shifting away from these claims. 
We could not identify any new references to their previously 
prominent carbon neutrality claims on their websites or public 
reports in 2023, even though both companies still appear 
to procure carbon credits equivalent to their scope 1 and 2 
emissions. However, not all companies are moving in the same 
direction: by contrast, Apple stepped up its carbon neutrality 
narrative with the announcement of its carbon-neutral smart 
watches in 2023 (see reaction; NewClimate Institute, 2023b).
 

56Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Table 15: Integrity of carbon neutrality claims identified from the companies assessed in this report
 WHAT IS THE CLAIM? AND WHAT DOES THE CLAIM REALLY MEAN?

Daimler Truck’s claim covers all production sites in Europe (Daimler Truck, 2023b, 2023a, p. 78, 2024, p. 84). It is based on an unspecified combination of efficiency 
measures, the procurement and generation of renewable electricity, and the procurement of carbon credits (Daimler Truck, 2023b). The company reports to procure only 
Gold Standard verified carbon credits but mostly refers to carbon crediting projects for renewable electricity generation (Daimler Truck, 2023a, p. 94, 2024); the 
additionality of such low hanging fruit projects is highly contentious (see Methodology section 4.1.2).

Unclear integrity

Very poor integrity

Danone asserts that it “builds its net zero commitment around the carbon neutrality of its production sites” (Danone, 2023a, p. 152). While the report is ambiguous about the 
coverage of this claim, other sources indicate that six of Danone’s production facilities are certified by the Carbon Trust as carbon neutral (Danone, 2022). It is unclear 
how many facilities Danone operates worldwide, and whether these six plants represent a significant volume of production. We could only identify information about 
two of these plants, in Ireland and Brazil. In both cases, the claims are based on a combination of standalone RECs, and the procurement of carbon credits to offset the 
remaining emissions (Danone, 2020b, 2021). Standalone RECs – essentially offsetting certificates for electricity – are the lowest quality means for procuring renewable 
electricity and are unlikely to have any meaningful impact to reduce GHG emissions (see section 3.2). For offsetting the rest of its emissions, Danone reports that it 
procures carbon credits from forest conservation projects in Brazil (Danone, 2021), but we could identify no details on the type of credits it procures in Ireland. While 
forest conservation will require more financial support to reach the scale required globally to limit the most damaging effects of climate change, such carbon storage does 
not offer the permanence to be considered equivalent to the reduction of emissions (see Methodology section 4.1.3).

Mars’s brand carbon neutrality claims cover only a small selection of its flagship brand products, and only in a selection of geographies. Mars Bar – for example – claims 
to be carbon neutral in the UK, Ireland and Canada (Mars, 2023b). We could not identify a list of other Mars products that claim carbon neutrality. The carbon neutral 
claim is based on the procurement of carbon credits and covers the full value chain emissions of the product, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from raw material 
extraction to disposal, meaning that the degree of compensation may be more commensurate than in the cases where companies make similar claims after offsetting only 
a portion of emissions. However, there are significant issues that affect the transparency of these claims. Firstly, although Mars specifies that emission reductions are a 
key component of the mitigation hierarchy before carbon credit procurement, the company does not specify to what extent emission reductions need to be achieved 
before a product is eligible to procure carbon credits and make this claim; it appears as if there is no minimum requirement for emission reductions and that carbon credit 
procurement can be the primary means for brands to claim carbon neutrality. Secondly, we could not identify information on the projects from which Mars has procured 
carbon credits. Without this information, the carbon neutrality claims are unsubstantiated and their integrity is unclear.

The Volkswagen Group claims “carbon neutral delivery” for electric vehicles by several of its European brands (Volkswagen, 2023b, 2024). Such claims might lead 
customers to believe that Volkswagen successfully managed to fully decarbonise electric vehicles’ value chain, including supply chains and their production. However, the 
company does not specify the share of emissions it has reduced along vehicle’s value chain, for example by using low-carbon steel for its vehicles manufacturing. The 
company further claims that eight production sites operate on a “carbon-neutral basis”. In contrast, Volkswagen’s German and Czech production sites rely on 
Volkswagen’s own electricity generation that remains highly depended on fossil fuels. The Group’s subsidiary VW Kraftwerk GmbH, which is responsible for the 
electricity and heat supply for German and Czech production plants, reports a share of around 37% of coal and fossil gas in its 2022 electricity mix (VW Kraftwerk, 
2023). To offset these emissions for its carbon neutral delivery claim, Volkswagen purchased carbon credits of a total volume of 5.9 MtCO2e in 2022 and 8.5 MtCO2e in 
2023 (Volkswagen, 2023b, 2024). These credits mainly stem from non-permanent carbon dioxide removals, for example the Kariba mega-project in Zimbabwe of which 
the company purchased carbon credits of around 1.1 MtCO2e in 2022 (Volkswagen, 2023a). The Swiss project developer South Pole, who ran the Kariba mega-project, 
decided to terminate and withdraw from the project entirely in October 2023 following allegations of inflated climate benefits and issues related to due diligence (Elgin 
and White, 2023). Volkswagen also plans to develop own projects generating carbon credits through a joint venture with ClimatePartner formed in 2022, but has yet to 
provide any further information on its future activities and the type of projects (Volkswagen, 2024; Volkswagen ClimatePartner, 2024).

In 2023, there was a notable trend among business consultancies and carbon credit sellers 
transitioning away from carbon neutrality labels. The business consultancy myclimate, an 
internationally recognised provider of carbon credits and carbon neutrality labels, announced 
in December 2022 that it will discontinue its climate neutrality label and transition to a new 
impact label aligning with the climate contribution model. This announcement explicitly 
recognises that the current market cannot deliver carbon credits that can credibly facilitate 
climate neutral claims in the era of the Paris Agreement (myclimate, 2022). Following suit, in 
April 2023, another business consultancy ClimatePartner introduced a “ClimatePartner certified” 
label while discontinuing their carbon neutral label (ClimatePartner, 2023). Similarly, in June 

2023, SouthPole announced its transition from their carbon neutrality labels to an alternative 
“Funding Climate Action” label, noting the increased scrutiny on carbon neutrality claims and 
the need for claims that can be made with confidence and transparency (SouthPole, 2023).

In the EU, legislators are ruling against carbon neutrality claims, although similar developments 
have yet to materialise in other regions. In 2024, the EU adopted a ban on climate-neutral 
advertising on products and services (European Parliament, 2024). This breakthrough legislation 
marks the first time globally where policymakers have banned carbon neutrality claims, potentially 
setting a precedent for regulatory developments in other countries.

A climate contribution refers to finance provided by a company 
to support climate change action beyond the company’s own 
value chain, without claiming to neutralise its own emissions. 
A company can claim to contribute to climate change mitigation 
activities when it does so without claiming ownership of 
the emission reduction outcomes and without subtracting 
associated reductions from their own GHG inventory or net-
zero target. In contrast to offsetting claims, which are more 
prone to greenwashing accusations, the climate contributions 
approach preserves transparency and helps address some 
of the most challenging “double counting” issues associated 
with the accounting of emission reductions by both “buyer” 
companies and “seller” countries (Fearnehough et al., 2023).

At least 4 of 20 companies report providing financial support 
for climate change mitigation projects without making 
associated offsetting claims. Danone, Stellantis, Volkswagen, 
and Walmart report their support for mitigation projects 
beyond their value chains without making neutralisation claims, 
although the scale of these projects appears too small to 
align with SBTi’s new beyond value chain mitigation (BVCM) 
recommendations, and none of these companies report their 
methods for determining the volume of their contributions. 
Despite positive developments during 2023 to operationalise 
the climate contribution approach, the model has not yet 
reached the degree of maturity to be implemented at scale. 
Nevertheless, some major companies, such as Klarna and 
Spotify, have started to transition towards this approach. 

The 2023 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor explored 
a number of potential reasons for the slow uptake of this 
approach (Day, Mooldijk, Hans, et al., 2023, p. 67) We perceived 
that there was insufficient pressure from consumers, investors, 
or governments to enhance the environmental integrity of 
neutralisation claims and regulate offsetting claims, as well as 
companies’ lack of knowledge and awareness that may hinder 
the adoption of the climate contribution approach. However, 
2023 saw significant developments addressing these barriers.

The publication of guidelines in 2023 and 2024 constitute concrete steps towards operationalising and mainstreaming 
climate contributions, but there remains a lack of specificity on the claims that companies can and cannot make based on the 
contributions they provide. Several developments in 2023 have contributed to moving the climate contribution model from a 
theoretical concept towards an implementation-ready model. However, undefined details that require further elaboration will 
determine the extent to which these developments represent a significant step forward or merely a repackaging of old approaches.

•	 The Gold Standard published a “Step by step guidance 
for organisations taking responsibility for their unabated 
emissions” (Gold Standard, 2024) which follows all best 
practice recommendations on BVCM and also provides 
prescriptive guidelines on claims.

•	 SBTi recommendations for beyond value chain 
mitigation (BVCM) 
In February 2024, SBTi published the outcome of 
its consultation process on recommendations for 
companies to engage in BVCM (Benson et al., 2024). 
The outcome is an operationalisation of the climate 
contribution approach; companies are recommended 
to provide finance – based on a carbon price applied to 
the volume of their own emission footprint – to climate 
change mitigation efforts outside of the companies’ 
value chain. Our methodology for assessing the integrity 
of climate contributions is aligned with SBTi’s main 
recommendations for BVCM, including the use of 
a money-for-tonne model for determining financial 
contributions through a science-aligned carbon price 
across all scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (Benson et al., 
2024). However, the SBTi report does not rule out 
the possibility of companies making compensation 
claims under the BVCM approach, which is a highly 
relevant omission. If a decision is made to depart from 
the core principles of SBTi to allow offsetting toward 
target fulfilment (see section 1.2), then the BVCM 
recommendations could have a substantially different 
meaning compared to the current situation.

Operationalising the climate contribution approach

•	 VCMI Claims Code of Practice 
The Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity initiative (VCMI) 
has released its integrity guidelines for corporate use 
of carbon credits. In some regards, the concept of 
VCMI’s Silver, Gold, and Platinum “carbon integrity” 
claims outlines a transparent and constructive approach. 
Under these claims, companies that have already 
achieved their climate targets can additionally procure 
carbon credits to take responsibility for their unabated 
emissions. These claims constitute a form of climate 
contribution approach. However, such contributions 
would be delivered exclusively through a tonne-for-
tonne model with carbon crediting projects, which may 
make the claims more prone to potentially misleading 
communications regarding the extent to which 
emissions are considered to be neutralised. This concern 
is heightened by the fact that the precise terms of the 
claim remain somewhat ambiguous, although companies 
are recommended not to claim the neutralisation of their 
emissions through this means (VCMI, 2023a). Despite 
this potentially positive development, it remains to be 
seen whether the VCMI carbon integrity claims will be 
picked up by companies, compared to VCMI’s separate 
claims framework, the beta scope 3 flexibility claim. 
In contrast to the contribution model set out in the 
carbon integrity claims, VCMIs beta Scope 3 Flexibility 
Claim would revive the traditional offsetting narrative, 
allowing companies to offset emissions towards their 
scope 3 targets, posing a major risk to corporate 
ambition (see section 1.2).

58Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



What may happen in 2024?

Details on claim terminology and finance recipients need to be clarified. Although the SBTi 
BVCM recommendations and VCMI carbon integrity claims represent frameworks that could 
be used for mainstreaming the climate contribution approach, key details for implementation 
remain unaddressed. Most importantly, the potential links between these frameworks and 
any emerging flexibility mechanisms need to be clarified:  the claims that companies can 
make with the contributions that they provide should be specified in clear terms to avoid a 
new generation of inconsistent and potentially misleading communications. More guidance is 
needed regarding where and how climate contributions could be channelled. With these details, 
business consultancies and project developers will be able to follow a clear framework, and 
more companies will be able to start using this model.

Identifying and supporting high-hanging fruit projects is crucial. The high hanging fruit of 
mitigation potential refers to the technologies and measures to decarbonise emission sources 
that remain otherwise entirely inaccessible to host country governments in the near- and 
medium-term future, on account of extraordinary costs or other insurmountable barriers 
that cannot reasonably be overcome (Day, Mooldijk, Posada, et al., 2023). The increasing 
clarity on how to pursue climate contributions should lead to a significant increase in flows of 
voluntary climate finance from companies. However, there remains a major concern about the 
quality and diversity of projects that can attract voluntary climate finance. The pathways to 
the operationalisation of climate contributions through the SBTi BVCM report and the VCMI 
Claims Code of Practice are quite focused on the continued use of carbon crediting projects 
under a contribution narrative. It may be possible but is likely very challenging for companies 
to aim for the high-hanging fruit of climate change mitigation projects, which are in great need 
of support to unlock and scale up technologies and practices for deeper decarbonisation of the 
most challenging emission sources. There remains a gap for an initiative to identify high-hanging 
fruit projects, for companies who wish to demonstrate their superior ambition.

59Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



4.2 Revision of the GHG Protocol
One of the major developments of 2023 for the architecture of 
corporate climate accountability frameworks is the initiation of 
the revision process for the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard 
and the GHG Protocol Guidelines for Scope 2 and Scope 3 
accounting. This extensive process is expected to result in 
the publication of revised standards and guidelines in 2026.

The standards and guidelines of the GHG Protocol are highly 
influential for the transparency and integrity of corporate 
climate action. They form a foundation for most of the other 
voluntary initiatives and governmental legislations that make 
up the landscape of the global corporate climate accountability 
framework, including major initiatives such as the Science 
Based Targets initiative. The revised GHG Protocol standards 
and guidelines will determine whether companies have tangible 
incentives or requirements to implement high-quality strategies 
and affect the extent to which companies can identify and 
exploit potential accounting loopholes to exaggerate their 
plans and progress.

Given that aspects of the GHG Protocol standards and 
guidelines underpin many of the key issues assessed in this 
report, our analysis of various topics in sections 1, 2 and 
3 each includes recommendations for the GHG Protocol 
revision process. These recommendations are compiled 
and summarised in this section. Further details on each 
recommendation can be found in the respective sections.

Resisting pressure to integrate offsetting into inventories

	� The categorisation and accounting of value chain emissions should be reconsidered to help companies, standard setters 
and other stakeholders to focus on the most critical decarbonisation indicators for each sector, which are well within 
companies’ direct control. Flexibility through offsetting is not the right solution to address the challenges that companies 
understandably face in implementing scope 3 targets (see section 1.2). 

	� Scope 2 and 3 guidance should not introduce ‘project-based accounting’ as an alternative to claim emissions reductions 
(see section 3.2). A proposal for the revision of the scope 2 guidance to introduce a new accounting method – labelled 
‘project-based accounting’ – would allow companies to claim reductions in their scope 2 emissions based on emissions 
avoided from renewable energy projects implemented anywhere in the world, whether inside or outside of the local 
grid region or market. Allowing for ‘project-based accounting’ either in scope 2 or scope 3 would essentially be the 
same in practice to offsetting with carbon credits, and ignores the responsibility that companies have to contribute to 
efforts to decarbonise the electricity grids that they use and the other emission sources that their businesses are built 
on. It is a highly contentious proposal for improving the GHG-P Guidance, given the increasing awareness of the various 
fundamental limitations of offsetting and the general shift we perceive away from this practice (see section 4.1).

	� Scope 3 guidance should only allow the introduction of ‘market-based methods’ for upstream scope 3 emissions if 
measures are taken to ensure high transparency and integrity of renewable electricity procurement (see improving 
market-based accounting methods below). If done with high transparency and integrity, this could incentivise companies 
to better develop their supply chain emission reduction strategies and engage with suppliers to help them reduce their 
energy-related emissions.  

Improving market-based accounting methods

These recommendations serve to improve transparency on key issues surrounding electricity procurement, enabling the 
identification of companies pursuing best practice approaches and encouraging the others to follow suit (see section 3.2). 

	� Scope 2 guidance should increase granularity on reporting for procurement of renewable electricity to distinguish 
between procurement methods such as standalone RECs, PPAs, and others, recognising the stark differences in the impact 
of these procurement constructs regarding the additionality of the renewable electricity that the companies claim. 

	� Scope 2 guidance should also impose stronger requirements on the additionality of renewable electricity procurement 
constructs, such as restrictions on the use of standalone RECs.

	� Scope 2 guidance should require companies to disclose information on the matching approach used when procuring 
renewable electricity and encourage a move towards hourly matching. This is crucial because hourly matching would 
stimulate demand for additional and novel renewable energy generation and storage technologies, while annual matching 
hides a significantly embedded reliance on fossil fuel generation.

60Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Recognising that bioenergy is not an equal  
alternative to non-combustible renewables 

	� The GHG protocol should include specific information on how to account for bioenergy 
emissions in all emission scopes. Within this guidance, it should be clear that bioenergy 
is not an equal alternative to modern renewables (see Section 3.3). Bioenergy is not 
an emissions-free energy source and is highly likely to have negative sustainability 
implications. These include, but are not limited to, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and 
food insecurity. Even when companies source bioenergy from ‘sustainable’ sources, there 
is the inherent problem that by using any type of bioenergy at all – which is and will 
remain a scarce resource – they push other companies to use non-sustainable biomass. To 
limit global warming to 1.5°C and protect ecosystems, it is key to reduce overall demand 
for biomass. Companies operating in sectors with viable alternatives for decarbonisation 
should pursue those avenues. (see section 3.5)

Clearer guidance on relevant boundaries for ‘direct’  
and ‘indirect’ use-phase emissions from sold products 

�

�

�

Scope 3 guidance should require companies to report both ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ use-phase 
emissions from their sold products separately. This could be done by creating an additional 
category for ‘indirect’ use-phase emissions. Direct use-phase emissions stem from products 
that directly consume energy when used, such as machinery or vehicles. Indirect use-phase 
emissions originate from products that indirectly consume energy when used, such as 
clothing that requires washing. It is important to separate these two categories as the level of 
control that a company has over indirect use-phase emissions is usually significantly lower 
than that over direct use-phase emissions. Additionally, integrating indirect use-phase 
emissions into company targets can sometimes be misleading as those emissions are largely 
outside the company’s control. Indirect use-phase emissions can be reduced through 
independent processes such as efficiency improvements in equipment and grid 
decarbonisation, without direct intervention of the company setting the target.  

The extent to which ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ use-phase emissions from sold products should be 
considered a mandatory part of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard should depend on the 
specific circumstances of the sector and the relevance of these emissions for companies’ 
overall targets and strategies. These categories are currently put together with the latter 
marked as optional for reporting. This is a significant gap in the existing standard as use-phase 
emissions can be very significant relative to the company’s total value chain emissions. In some 
cases, such as for electricity retailers, the absence of a requirement to report emissions related 
to sales of products that are not directly sold to end-users creates an accounting loophole. 
Electricity retailers that purchase lower-cost wholesale electricity comprising a mix of 
renewable and non-renewable sources could claim zero downstream emissions if they claim to 
have passed the renewable portion of that electricity onto customers while reselling the 
remaining electricity to other sales partners. This could diminish incentives for electricity 
retailers to pursue high-quality renewable electricity procurement

Scope 3 guidance should also be further specified to include information on reporting 
boundaries for certain products. Especially when companies’ products are positioned 
‘upstream’ in the value chain, such as raw materials or inputs like steel, which go through 
numerous subsequent processes before reaching an end consumer. In these cases, it is 
crucial to clarify not only which types of ‘use-phase’ emissions that need to be reported but 
also up to which point companies need to track and report emissions. Without that clarity, 
companies operating upstream in the value chain could experience significant uncertainty 
regarding their emissions. For example, Thyssen-Krupp, a steel and machinery 
manufacturer, reported 614 MtCO2e of downstream scope 3 emissions in 2020, but only 
1.8 MtCO2e for the same category in 2021 (Thyssenkrupp, 2022; Day, Mooldijk, Hans, et 
al., 2023), although both methods would be consistent with GHG Protocol guidelines. Such 
an improvement would help companies better understand which emissions they need to 
take responsibility for and set targets and measures accordingly.

4.3 Evolving from voluntary initiatives to formal accountability
Some extracts of this section are adapted from The Corporate Accountability Loop (Hans et al., 2023).

Summary

The integrity of the current corporate accountability system 
is impaired by inherent tensions deriving from a lack of 
institutional separation and direct corporate influence. Multiple 
functions of the corporate accountability system are currently 
performed by a small group of overlapping initiatives without 
sufficient institutional separation and independence. This setup 
allows companies to directly influence activities under specific 
accountability functions, despite them being the entities 
to be held accountable. Urgent adjustments are needed to 
establish institutional separation and independence among 
actors performing the functions of standard setting, validations, 
and mobilisation. A mature and functional system eventually 
requires a shift from voluntary initiatives to regulation, 
accredited verification and validation entities, and effective 
advocacy and litigation.

The findings of our analysis show that – while voluntary 
initiatives play a key role in the corporate climate 
accountability system – the current over-reliance on voluntary 
initiatives for many functions of the system does not result 
in sufficiently credible corporate climate action, despite the 
increasing urgency of the climate crisis. These pioneering 
initiatives were formed at a time when corporate climate 
action was in its early stages. As we have now reached a stage 
where most of the largest and most influential multinational 
corporates regularly announce targets and strategies to 
reduce emissions, the model of voluntary mobilisation may 
have outgrown its original purpose.

Recognising the need for enhanced integrity within the 
current system, the UNFCCC Secretariat released its 
Recognition and Accountability Framework (RAF) in 2023 
and is engaged in consultations regarding its implementation 
plan (UNFCCC, 2023c). 

Status quo: The integrity of the current corporate accountability system is impaired by inherent tensions deriving 
from a lack of institutional separation and direct corporate influence.

Hans et al. (2023) outlined the key conceptual functions of the corporate climate accountability system in the Corporate 
Accountability Loop (Figure 6). In assessing the status quo of this system and the capacity of these key functions to operate 
effectively, the authors identified key issues in the current framework that create inherent tensions:

	r A small group of overlapping initiatives perform multiple functions within the current corporate accountability system 
without sufficient institutional separation and independence. 

Single initiatives or actors perform multiple functions simultaneously, including (1) developing standards (2) mobilising 
companies, and (3) validating companies’ strategies. For example, several partner initiatives to the UNFCCC’s Race to Zero 
campaign, such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) or the SME Climate Hub, perform these multiple functions, 
often resulting from their role as pioneering entities in mobilising and enabling companies to set climate strategies.  

These initiatives were established at a time when corporate climate action was in its infancy, and the combination of 
these functions may have been considered most effective at the time. However, the global business community has 
now reached a stage where it has become standard practice for most of the largest and most influential multinational 
corporates to announce targets and strategies to reduce emissions. In this evolved context, voluntary initiatives 
and even their philanthropic supporters might face an inherent tension stemming from the multifaceted nature of 
their roles. On the one hand, for example, the development of a standard for 1.5°C-compatible corporate transition 
plans should be based on the requirements indicated by the latest scientific literature, even if this might imply very 
challenging benchmarks. On the other hand, if the initiative developing such a standard is also performing the function 
of mobilising as many companies as possible to participate, then it may be necessary to identify compromises that could 
undermine each of those important functions.

	r Companies often hold significant influence over activities under specific accountability functions, despite them being 
the entities to be held accountable for. 

In the current system, companies play an integral role in consensus-aligned development processes for voluntary 
standards and decarbonisation benchmarks. Such processes aim to reconcile scientific findings with corporate 
interests, with companies dedicating substantial personnel and financial resources to participate and influence these 
processes. Companies' climate strategies subsequently are directly assessed against these standards, guidance, 
or decarbonisation benchmarks that they helped to develop in the first place. This creates a conflict of interests 
for companies as they directly influence activities conducted by voluntary initiatives and actors under the core 
accountability functions of the current system.

62Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Prompt adjustments to the existing system: 
Establish institutional separation and 
independence between actors performing the 
functions of standard setting, validations, and 
mobilisation.

The existing shortcomings of the current corporate 
accountability system call for immediate improvements to 
facilitate a move towards higher integrity and to better identify 
genuine corporate leadership.

	� Institutional separation for key functions of the 
accountability system mitigates some of the most 
fundamental tensions that impair the integrity of the 
current system. Mobilisation and capacity-building 
initiatives should aim to engage as many companies as 
possible, while those setting science-aligned standards 
should not compromise between companies’ interests 
and scientific findings.

	� Compliance, grievance, and whistle-blowing 
mechanisms must be introduced within existing 
initiatives to accompany this institutional separation. 
Such mechanisms enable researchers, civil society, 
and other actors to scrutinise corporate climate 
strategies and accountability process to flag potential 
issues. These issues may include companies’ non-
compliance with standards or validators’ failure to 
follow procedures for validation and verification. 
Such mechanisms would also depend on independent 
oversight bodies that can ensure the removal of 
companies’ validations in case of non-compliance. 

Evolution to formal accountability: Shift from voluntary initiatives to regulation, accredited verification 
and validation entities, and effective advocacy and litigation.

The United Nation’s High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) ‘Integrity Matters’ report on net-zero pledges emphasised the need to develop 
“regulation and standards in areas including net zero pledges, transition plans and disclosure” as one of their ten recommendations 
(UN HLEG, 2022). The corporate climate accountability system is already being reshaped by emerging climate regulations around the 
world. This shift is crucial for determining how target validations and performance verifications will be executed, and whether the 
system enables effective advocacy and litigation activities: 

	� The legally binding nature of regulation contributes to an enforceable accountability system in which it is no longer 
voluntary for companies to commit to corporate climate strategies and in which companies and validators can be held 
accountable for misleading targets and claims that undermine the integrity of corporate climate action. Recently, several 
governments have introduced, or are introducing, regulation on issues such as corporate emission disclosures or corporate 
transition plans (Hale et al., 2022; Oxford Net Zero, 2023). In the EU, for example, regulations across multiple EU 
directives could lead to legally binding requirements for corporate climate disclosure and corporate transition plans in line 
with EU-specific 1.5°C decarbonisation benchmarks (Pugliese and Godinot, 2022). Comprehensive regulation introduced 
in one jurisdiction can directly influence other jurisdictions due to the global nature of corporate value chains. 

	� The introduction of regulation or international standards will enable target validations and performance verifications by 
accredited and legally liable entities. Like traditional financial auditing by accounting firms, entities performing validations 
and verifications could undergo accreditations by regulators and can be held legally liable in case of negligence. 

	� The formalisation of the accountability system can enhance the effectiveness of the advocacy and litigation activities. 
In recent years, numerous plaintiffs such as NGOs, citizens, and environmental law firms across different jurisdictions 
have engaged in litigation activities against inadequate corporate climate action (Setzer and Higham, 2022, 2023; 
UNEP, 2023). The emergence of legislation might introduce more specific legal liabilities for companies, as well as 
voluntary initiatives and actors involved in the validation and verification of 1.5°C-compatible climate strategies. Such 
legal liability does not exist in the current system, which prevents advocacy and litigation from effectively holding 
companies accountable through legal means. 

	� This necessary shift includes an important role for voluntary initiatives. The shift to legally binding regulation is necessary 
to achieve a functional accountability system but it might be prone to several potential issues. Regulations might be 
fragmented across different countries or regions worldwide, may not aligned with the latest science due to political 
considerations and the influence of vested interests, and could reinforce global inequalities through transboundary effects. 
In this context, voluntary initiatives and actors can play an important future role in scrutinising forthcoming regulations 
and continuing to advance the understanding of good practice according to the latest science, equity, and climate 
justice considerations. Such activities can promote upward convergence to common and high-ambition standards by 
consolidating good practice approaches and support their transition into legally binding measures (Hale, 2021).

4.4 Summary of recommendations for the evolution of the corporate climate accountability system

Recommendations for strengthening the corporate climate accountability system

Evolution from carbon neutrality claims to beyond 
value chain mitigation (BVCM) contributions

	� Regulators worldwide should replicate the EU’s 
landmark legislation banning the use of carbon neutrality 
claims for products and services, recognising the 
fundamental limitations of such claims.

	� SBTi and VCMI should further align their 
recommendations for climate contributions. These 
recommendations should provide more specificity on 
how exactly companies could channel finance and 
should specify that such contributions cannot lead to 
neutralisation claims: BVCM should not be used as an 
umbrella term to legitimate the further use of carbon 
credits and/or climate neutrality claims (see section 1.2). 

GHG Protocol revision process

To strengthen integrity, the GHG Protocol revision process should:

	� Improve market-based accounting methods by 
increasing reporting granularity, additionality 
requirements and hourly matching for renewable 
electricity procurement.

	� Resist pressure to integrate offsetting into inventories 
through so-called ‘project-based accounting’. 

	� Recognise that bioenergy is not an equal alternative to 
non-combustible renewables and include guidance on how 
to account for bioenergy emissions in all emission scopes. 

	� Clarify guidance on relevant sector-specific reporting 
boundaries for ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ use-phase 
emissions from sold products, recognising the specific 
circumstances of each sector. 

Current and future voluntary standard setters  
(e.g. SBTi, GHG Protocol and CDP):

	� Standard setters should ensure to follow science-
aligned approaches to the development of standards, 
guidance, and decarbonisation benchmarks. Such 
processes would need to be proactively safeguarded 
against excessive direct influence or compromise 
with corporate interests.

	� Standard setters should introduce compliance, 
grievance, and whistleblowing mechanisms in voluntary 
initiatives to enable effective public scrutiny. 

Regulators at the national and international level

	� Regulators should initiate a shift from voluntary 
accountability initiatives and towards formal 
regulation that includes accredited verification and 
validation entities, and enables effective advocacy 
and litigation. 

	� Regulators should establish institutional separation and 
independence between actors performing the functions 
of standard setting, validations and mobilisation.

SECTION B
COMPANY ANALYSES

This section of the 2024 Corporate Climate Responsibility 
Monitor includes an in-depth assessment of the integrity of 
the climate change mitigation strategies from 20 of the world’s 
largest companies.

66Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



We assess five of the largest global companies – excluding majority state-owned companies 
– from four key sectors: agrifood producers and retailers, automobile manufacturing, electric 
utilities, and fashion. 

•	 For electric utilities and fashion, we select the top five global companies from each of 
these sectors according to their annual revenue in 2022 (Forbes, 2023). For electric 
utilities, this includes Duke Energy, Enel, ENGIE, Iberdrola and Korea Electric Power 
Corporation (KEPCO). For fashion, this includes Adidas, Fast Retailing, H&M Group, 
Inditex and Nike.

•	 For automobile manufacturers, we select the top five global companies by revenue 
including also at least 2 companies that are specialised in producing heavy duty trucks 
only. This is to gain insights on the integrity of climate plans for heavy duty vehicle 
manufacturing, since previous iterations of the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 
have focused only on light duty vehicle manufacturing. The selection includes Daimler 
Truck, Stellantis, Toyota, Volkswagen Group and Volvo Group.

•	 For the agrifood sector, we select the four largest companies with targets formulated 
under SBTi’s new FLAG guidance: Nestlé, Tesco, Mars, Danone. This specific sample 
selection is to test the hypothesis that the new FLAG guidance can improve the integrity 
of agrifood companies’ targets. In addition to these four companies, we also select 
Walmart for assessment due to its high relevance as by far the largest company in the 
sector, and as the largest company in the world across all sectors.

•	 Our selection for all sectors excludes majority state-owned companies due to our 
perception that fundamental differences in management structures and decision-making 
structures for climate change strategy may significantly detract from the comparability of 
these companies’ plans, and the insights that we can draw from the company sample.

Most – but not all – of the companies assessed have committed to high-profile climate change 
mitigation pledges under the Science Based Targets initiative. The key objective of the analysis 
is to identify replicable good practice while assessing the integrity of the most influential global 
corporate actors that are putting themselves forwards as climate leaders and role models for 
other companies. Scrutiny of their plans is also necessary to identify whether these influential 
leaders really are setting the right examples, and whether the guidance and frameworks upon 
which they are making their plans are sufficient. However – aside from in the agrifood sector 
– this was not a selection criterion for this iteration of the Corporate Climate Responsibility 
Monitor; we have assessed the largest companies by revenue, according to the considerations 
listed above, and it is a coincidence that most of these companies are also members of major 
initiatives such as SBTi.

An overview of the selected companies and our evaluations is presented in Table 16. The 20 
companies covered by this monitor account for approximately USD 2.3 trillion of revenue in 
2022 (Forbes, 2023). Their total self-reported GHG emission footprints in 2019, including scope 
3 emissions, amount to approximately 3.9 GtCO2e. This is equivalent to roughly 7% of global 
GHG emissions.5 Eight of the 20 companies selected through the process described above were 
also assessed in the 2022 or 2023 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor.

5    Some overlap in emission statistics is likely in the cases that one company’s scope 3 emissions are included in the 
scope 1 or 2 emissions of another company. We anticipate that any overlap is marginal and of limited significance 
to the key insights derived from this report. The companies’ combined emission footprint may also be higher, due

Assessments were made based on public information identified by the authors. A poor rating may not necessarily be an indication that a company’s climate strategy is 
weak, but could also indicate that the information was insufficient to confirm good practice. Ambitious companies can improve their ratings by ensuring that all aspects 
of their climate responsibility strategies are transparently and accurately disclosed, and in the public domain.

Our company-specific assessments include a rating of the transparency and integrity of their 
approaches across four key elements of corporate climate responsibility as presented in the 
methodological overview (Good Practice Overview, p13): 1 - Tracking and disclosure of emissions; 
2 – Setting specific and substantiated targets; 3 – reducing emissions; and 4 – Responsibility 
for unabated and residual emissions: 

Our assessments include a rating of the transparency and integrity of companies’ approaches. 
Transparency refers to the extent to which a company publicly discloses the information 
necessary to fully understand the integrity of its approaches towards the various elements of 
corporate climate responsibility. Integrity, in this context, measures the quality, credibility and 
comprehensiveness of those approaches.

Full details on our methodology for assessing good practice across these four areas can be found 
in the accompanying methodological document: Guidance and assessment criteria for good practice 
corporate emission reduction and net-zero targets: Version 4.0 (NewClimate Institute, 2024).

The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor promotes transparency with the philosophy that 
consumers, regulators, shareholders, and other observers should be able to follow and assess 
the integrity of companies’ claims. Accordingly, the company assessments in this section are 
based only on publicly available information that could be identified by the authors. Each 
rating represents the authors’ understanding of the publicly available information. In some 
cases, company information was scattered across different sources (e.g. annual reports, press 
releases and statements, webpages, and other marketing materials); it is possible in this process 
that information may have been misinterpreted, or overlooked. Companies should consider 
how to present information as transparently as possible, to ensure that observers are able to 
readily identify all the relevant information necessary to understand their climate strategies.

•	 Automotive manufacturers’ emissions mostly originate in the use phase of its sold 
cars, vans, trucks, and buses and from sourced products such as steel or batteries. The 
accelerated phase-in of electric vehicles and the procurement of low-carbon products 
provide key levers for manufacturers to address these emissions along their value chain. 

•	 Emission disclosures by automotive manufacturers remain inadequate and incomplete. 
Light-duty vehicle manufacturers generally underreport the use-phase emissions of sold 
cars (Volkswagen, Toyota) while heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers show a mixed picture, 
with some disclosing use-phase emissions (Volvo Group) and others not at all (Daimler 
Truck). Integrated companies producing both light- and heavy-duty vehicles do not include 
the latter’s use-phase emissions in their group level reporting (Volkswagen, Toyota).       

•	 The integrity of emission reduction targets differs substantially between light- and heavy-
duty manufacturers. Light-duty vehicle manufacturers continue to set inadequate 2030 targets 
without 1.5°C-aligned phase-out targets for internal combustion engines (Volkswagen, Toyota). 
Only Stellantis stands out with its 2030 ICE phase-out target for the European market. Heavy-
duty vehicle manufactures apply different but generally ambitious target-setting approaches. 
Some companies set specific short-term targets towards 2030 (brands under Volkswagen 
Group, Volvo Group) while others set specific 1.5°C-aligned phase-out dates in the longer term 
towards 2050 (Daimler Truck) alongside supporting the charging infrastructure roll-out. 

•	 Emissions from the sourcing of upstream material like steel remain poorly addressed 
across the entire manufacturer’s sample. Only Volvo Group lays out more comprehensive 
and transparent plans by targeting at least 10% low-carbon steel and aluminium 
procurement by 2030 supported by signed purchase agreements and collaborations with 
low-carbon steel producers.

•	 Automotive manufacturers generally fail to clarify the extent to which their net-
zero and carbon neutrality targets beyond 2030 will be achieved through offsetting. 
Companies neither disclose the envisioned amount nor type of carbon credits to offset or 
neutralise emission in the future (Daimler Truck, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo Group). Some 
companies communicate climate contributions beyond their value chain although these 
remain very modest compared to today’s emissions (Stellantis, Volkswagen).

69Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



5.2 Sectoral transition framework

Global emissions from heavy trucks and buses (heavy-
duty vehicles) follow a more geographically differentiated 
trajectory considering less mature zero-carbon technologies 
available. Similarly to cars and vans, emissions from heavy-duty 
vehicles in advanced economies must reach zero emissions by 
2050 and reduce by around 20% by 2030 and 70% by 2040 
in the interim. Emissions from the use of heavy trucks and 
buses in emerging markets and developing economies can still 
increase by 5% by 2030 and then reduce by around 35% and 
85% respectively by 2040 and 2050. In this context, recently 
published literature defines 1.5°C-compatible emission 
intensities from the use of heavy-duty trucks as of 30–61 
gCO2 per tonne-km by 2030 (IEA, 2023c; Teske et al., 2023), 
further going down to 0–3 gCO2 per tonne-km by 2050.

Automotive manufacturers’ climate strategies ought to 
avoid false technological solutions with inferior efficiency, 
sustainability, and effectiveness. Such technologies include, 
among others, the use of biofuels, e-fuels, and fuel cell vehicles 
for light-duty transport. For example, biofuel production at 
scale faces the high likelihood of competing with other 
environmental and social interests, such as food production, 
biodiversity, and forest protection (Clarke et al., 2022, p. 42). 
This is especially relevant for the automotive sector given 
that technological alternatives are readily available, while 
sustainably sourced biofuel might be needed in other sectors 
of the economy with fewer alternatives available like aviation. 
Alternative fuels such as e-fuel produced with hydrogen 
energy and hydrogen-based fuel cells, however, also require 
much greater amounts of renewable electricity production 
than battery electric vehicles (Transport & Environment, 
2018). Such technologies therefore might only be an efficient, 
effective and sustainable alternative—alongside battery 
electric vehicles—for heavy-duty market segments (Jaramillo 
et al., 2022, pp. 1070–1071).      
 

The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report emphasises the need 
for a rapid and transformative change of the global transport 
sector to stay below the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature 
limit. Global transport-related CO2 emissions including global 
aviation and maritime shipping must fall by around 59% by 
2050 relative to modelled 2020 emissions to limit warming 
to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2022, p. 32; Pathak et al., 2022, p. 98). These 
global reductions are subject to regionally differentiated trends.

Global emissions from cars and vans (light duty vehicles) 
must significantly decline by 2030 across all geographies 
given readily available zero-emission technologies and 
reach zero emissions globally by 2050 at the latest. For 
advanced economies, the International Energy Agency (IEA) 
estimates that annual use-phase CO2 emissions from light-duty 
vehicles need to be reduced by around 45% by 2030, over 
90% by 2040 and finally reach zero emissions by 2050 to be 
compatible with the 1.5°C temperature limit (IEA, 2023c, p. 
93), all compared to a 2022 baseline. In emerging markets and 
developing economies, the IEA states that CO2 emissions from 
cars and vans can be reduced at a slower pace towards zero 
emissions by 2050, namely by around 10% by 2030 and over 
70% by 2040 compared to a 2022 baseline. In this context, 
recently published literature identifies global 1.5°C-compatible 
emission intensities for newly sold passenger vehicles of 
around 30 gCO2 per passenger km by 2030, further going 
down to less than 1 gCO2 by 2050 (Dietz et al., 2023, p. 8).

Key actions and measures for automotive manufacturers

Measures addressing emissions from the use of light-duty vehicles (downstream scope 3)

Emissions from the use of sold cars and vans (scope 3 category 11) represent the largest source of emissions across automobile manufacturers’ value chains. 

Phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICEs)    Critical transitional measure
Global
•	 The global sales share for zero emission vehicles must 

reach 67–95% by 2030 and 100% between 2035–2040 
(CAT, 2020, p. 27; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 
2023c, pp. 88, 93)

•	 These decarbonisation milestones consequently leading 
to a complete phase-out of ICE sales by 2035–2040 are 
in line with the COP26 declaration on zero emission cars 
mandating 100% of total sales of passenger vehicles 
and vans by 2040 globally (COP26 Presidency, 2021; 
SBTi , 2024f, pp.16–17.

Advanced economies
•	 Advanced economies such as China, US, the EU27 

and Japan must already reach a 95–100% sales share 
of zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100% latest 
by 2035 (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 
10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4).

•	 These decarbonisation milestones are fully in line 
with the COP26 declaration on zero emission cars 
mandating 100% of total sales of passenger vehicles 
and vans in leading markets by 2035 (COP26 
Presidency, 2021; SBTi , 2024f, pp.16–17).    

Support the roll-out of vehicle charging infrastructure   Enabling measure
The electric vehicles uptake requires large-scale investments in electric charging infrastructure 
and related grid connections (Pathak et al., 2022, p. 98; IEA, 2023b, pp. 123–129). Recent analysis 
estimates the need for around 17 million public electric vehicle charging points globally by 2030, 
18 million by 2035 and 31 million by 2050 (IEA, 2023c, p. 93). Automotive manufacturers can 
directly and indirectly support the roll-out of vehicle charging infrastructure, for example through 
investments or collaborations to install and operate publicly accessible charging points.

Enabling measures to support the roll-out of vehicle charging infrastructure can underpin 
and substantiate an automotive manufacturer’s 1.5°C-compatible business model, but still 
critically hinge on the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICEs).

Support of demand management solutions   Enabling measure
The systemic transformation of the passenger transport sector will require demand 
management solutions to reduce single vehicle usage (Pathak et al., 2022, p. 98; Boehm et 
al., 2023, pp. 76–98). Such demand-side measures can include, among others, the support 
of carpooling, public transportation, and mobility-as-a-service while investing in integrated 
urban mobility solutions. These measures generally aim to decrease individual vehicle 
ownership and encourage alternative mobility concepts.

Enabling measures to support demand management solutions can underpin and substantiate 
an automotive manufacturer’s 1.5°C-compatible business model, but still critically hinge on 
the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICEs).

Electric vehicles powered by decarbonised electricity have a 
large potential to reduce land-based transport greenhouse 
gas emissions on a life cycle basis (IPCC, 2022, p. 32). Several 
studies identify 1.5°C-aligned decarbonisation milestones for 
the phase out of internal combustion engines (ICEs) replaced 
by electric and low-emission vehicles at the global and regional 
level (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Teske et 
al., 2022, p. 4; WBA, 2022; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; 
IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93).

71Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Measures to address emissions from the use of heavy-duty vehicles (downstream scope 3)

Emissions from the use of trucks, buses, and other heavy-duty vehicles (scope 3 category 11) represent the largest source of emissions across automotive manufacturers’ value chains.

Development & phase-in of zero-carbon heavy-duty vehicles   Critical transitional measure

Heavy-duty trucks

•	 The global sales share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) 
and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) must reach between 
30–37% by 2030 globally and 100% by 2040 in advanced 
economies and China (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Boehm 
et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). 

•	 A complete phase-out of trucks with internal 
combustion engines would need to be achieved 
between 2045–2050 globally (Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 
77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93).  

Buses

•	 The global sales share of BEVs and FCEVs must 
be reach between 56–60% by 2030 globally and 
100% by 2030 in advanced economies and China 
(UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 
77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). 

•	 A complete phase-out of buses with internal 
combustion engines would need to be achieved 
between 2035–2050 globally (Boehm et al., 2023, 
pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023b, pp. 88, 93).

Support the roll-out of charging infrastructure   Enabling measure
The roll-out of charging infrastructure plays a crucial role for the electrification of heavy-duty 
vehicles like trucks and buses, given the substantial costs associated with high-power charging 
infrastructure (Jaramillo et al., 2022, pp. 1071–1073). Investment in shared charging infrastructure 
at key transport hubs, such as bus and truck depots, freight distribution centres, and ports, is 
essential to encourage the transition to battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles in the 
heavy transport sector. Recent analyses, for example, estimate the need for around 12 million 
hydrogen refuelling stations globally by 2030, 15 million by 2035 and 45 million by 2050 (IEA, 
2023c, p. 93).

Enabling measures to support the roll-out of charging infrastructure can underpin and substantiate 
an automotive manufacturer’s 1.5°C-compatible business model, but still critically hinge on the 
phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICEs).

Decarbonizing long-range heavy-duty vehicles like trucks 
and buses can be achieved through battery-electric haulage, 
electric road systems, and hydrogen- or biofuel-based 
technologies (Pathak et al., 2022, p. 98). Challenges related 
to driving range, costs, and infrastructure availability need to be 
addressed, particularly in the commercialisation of hydrogen-
based fuel-cell vehicles that require an increased capacity for 
low-carbon hydrogen production to be an effective emissions 
reduction strategy. Several studies identify 1.5°C-aligned 
decarbonisation milestones for the phase out of internal 
combustion engines (ICEs) in buses and heavy trucks at the 
global and regional level (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Mission 
Possible Partnership, 2022, p. 40; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 
77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93).

72Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Measures to address emissions from sourced materials to produce cars, vans, trucks, and buses (upstream scope 3)

Emissions from purchased goods and services to produce cars, vans, trucks, and buses (scope 3 category 1) represents the second largest emissions source across automotive 
manufacturers’ value chains.  

Sourcing of low-carbon steel, aluminium, and other materials 
  Critical transitional measure
The sourcing of low-carbon steel, aluminium and other upstream materials is highly relevant 
for the decarbonisation of an automotive manufacturer's value chain considering that the 
production of these materials is currently an emissions-intensive process (WEF, 2020, p. 15; 
W. Liu et al., 2023). 

To support the procurement of zero-carbon upstream materials, automotive manufacturers 
can, among other solutions, partner with suppliers committed to producing zero-emission 
upstream materials, invest in research and development of innovative production methods, 
or adopt responsible sourcing practices. Additionally, they can engage in circular economy 
practices, such as recycling and reusing components, to further minimise environmental impact 
and promote a more sustainable and decarbonised automotive industry. 

Sourcing and/or in-house production of low-carbon batteries 
  Critical transitional measure
The manufacture of electric-vehicle batteries can account for up to 60% of the embedded 
greenhouse-gas emissions in electric vehicle production (Linder et al., 2023, p. 2). For 
this reason, reducing emissions during the battery manufacturing stage is indispensable 
to fully harness the emissions mitigation capabilities of battery electric vehicles (Pathak 
et al., 2022, p. 98). To support the external procurement or in-house production of zero-
carbon batteries, automotive manufacturers can support the switch to renewable energy 
at every step throughout the battery value chain, invest in research and development of 
innovative production methods, and entre into strategic collaboration with suppliers of 
zero-carbon batteries.

5.3 Daimler Truck

74Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Daimler Truck 

The assessment is based on the 2022 sustainability report; the information in the 2023 
sustainability report published in March 2024 does not lead to any changes in our evaluation.

Daimler Truck AG (hereafter: Daimler Truck) is one of the 
world’s largest manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles such as 
trucks and buses. Most of its emissions originate from the use 
phase of its sold trucks and buses, as well as sourced materials 
like steel, but the company does not disclose these emissions 
along its value chain. Ambitious sales targets for zero emission 
vehicles and plans to roll out charging infrastructure in key 
markets by 2039 and 2050 indicate the intend towards the 
1.5°C-aligned transition by mid-century. However, significant 
gaps remain in Daimler Truck’s climate strategy, particularly 
regarding the transparency and specificity on its reduction 
measures for 2030 and its offsetting strategy to meet its 
carbon neutrality pledges.

Daimler Truck has not disclosed any emissions related to its 
value chain since its spin-off from the Daimler AG in 2021. In the 
company’s 2023 sustainability reporting, we could not identify 
any estimates or transparent explanations for this absence 
(Daimler Truck, 2022b, 2023a; Shades of Green, 2023, p. 5). 
While the company annually reports on its operational emissions 
(scope 1 and 2), emissions from the use-phase of sold heavy-
duty vehicles and the sourcing of upstream products such as 
steel, aluminium or batteries represent by far the largest share of 
emissions along heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers’ value chains.

Ambitious sales targets for zero emission vehicles in key 
markets by 2039 and globally by 2050 indicate Daimler 
Truck’s intent to transition away from internal combustion 
engines in the longer term in alignment with the 1.5°C 
temperature goal. Daimler Truck pledges 100% sales of 
battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles 
(FCEVs) in Europe, the United States and Japan by 2039 — 
and globally by 2050 (Daimler Truck, 2023a, pp. 78, 81–82, 
93). These targets align with the 1.5°C-compatible milestones 
identified in the literature (see detailed assessment in Annex II). 
For 2030, however, the company only sets an aspirational and 
non-committal intention to sell “up to 60%” of zero-emission 
vehicles in Europe, Japan, and the United States by 2030 
(Daimler Truck, 2023a, pp. 78, 81, 93). The vague and non-
committal wording of ‘up to’ gives the company leeway to sell 
significantly fewer vehicles. We could not identify any lower-
bound or committal sales target for 2030. For this reason, we 
cannot assess the company’s 2030 ambition.

Daimler Truck aims to meet the sales targets by promoting the 
roll-out of charging infrastructure. The company has formed 
two jointed ventures in its key markets of Europe and the 
United States (Daimler Truck, 2021, 2022a). In Europe, it has 
partnered with other manufacturers Traton and Volvo Group 
to invest EUR 0.5 billion in deploying a high-performance 
public charging network for battery electric trucks and coaches 
(Daimler Truck, 2021). In the United States, the company 
entered into a joint venture with a total funding volume of USD 
0.65 billion to develop a nationwide charging network for BEV 
and FCEVs (Daimler Truck, 2022a).

Daimler Truck’s carbon neutrality pledges for 2025, 2039 
and 2050 remain unsubstantiated as the company provides 
no information on the extent to which it will reduce its own 
emissions. The company sets no specific emission reduction 
target accompanying its 2050 carbon neutrality pledge or for 
the scope- and geography-specific pledges between 2025 
and 2050. Since the company’s pledges do not entail any 
commitment to deep decarbonisation (i.e., a reduction of at 
least 90% of 2019 emissions across the entire value chain), 
labelling them as ‘carbon neutrality targets’ may mislead 
consumers and investors and does not align with recent 
guidance on meaningful target setting (ISO, 2022; UN HLEG, 
2022; SBTi, 2023d).

Daimler Truck’s climate strategy includes some smaller-scale 
activities to reduce upstream value chain emissions but does not 
provide comprehensive plans nor specific milestones to meet 
its targets. For example, Daimler Truck mentions participating 
in CDP’s supply chain program or its plans to electrify logistics 
supplying the German Wörth production plant by 2030 (Daimler 
Truck, 2023a, pp. 90–91). While these are relevant measures 
Daimler Truck does not present a comprehensive package 
of measures, including their respective timelines, scope, and 
expected impact, to decarbonise purchased products and 
services like low-carbon steel. It remains unclear how the 
company intends to achieve its objective for carbon-neutral 
products and services in Europe, the United States and Japan by 
2039 (Daimler Truck, 2023a, p. 78).

The lack of disclosure on procurement constructs to meet its 
100% renewable targets undermines the promising setup 
of quarter-hourly matching for procured electricity by most 
European production sites. Daimler Truck claims that, in 2022, 
most of its European production sites have procured 100% 
renewable electricity from wind, solar, and hydropower while 
matching production and demand every quarter hour (Daimler 
Truck, 2023a, p. 94). However, the company does not disclose 
any information on the procurement constructs underpinning this 
claim. Similarly, the lack of information on future procurement 
constructs prevents an independent evaluation of its target 
to supply 100% renewable electricity to production sites in 
the United States, Japan, and India by 2025 and all in-house 
production sites globally by 2030 (Daimler Truck, 2023a, p. 94).

Daimler Truck provides limited information on the amount 
and type of carbon credits used to claim ‘carbon neutral’ 
production by European production sites in 2022. To make 
this claim, Daimler Truck has offset its scope 1 and scope 2 
emissions at European production sites and selected other 
sites using Gold Standard-verified carbon credits for emission 
mitigation projects (Daimler Truck, 2023a, p. 94). Apart from 
illustrative project examples of geothermal energy installation 
and reduction of CO2 emission during the process of drinking 
water purification, the company neither specifies the extent 
to which it relies on offset credits nor the type and prices for 
the credits purchased, making this claim highly ambiguous and 
contentious. All other carbon neutrality claims by Daimler Truck 
face similar issues as Daimler Truck does not communicate 
any integrity and sustainability criteria of its future offsetting 
strategy. Moreover, the focus of the carbon neutrality 
claim on production sites may be misleading to non-expert 
audiences, given that most of the company’s GHG emission 
footprint derives from the use of vehicles. The type of vehicles 
manufactured vehicles is the most relevant climate issue, rather 
than the way in which the vehicles are produced.

76Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Stellantis
Stellantis is an automotive company headquartered in the 
Netherlands, comprising brands such as Fiat, Peugeot, Opel and 
Citroën. Most of Stellantis’ emissions originate in the use phase 
of its vehicles (88% of 2022 emissions). The company commits to 
reaching ‘carbon net zero’ in 2038, with its plans to reduce at least 
90% of its vehicles’ CO2 emissions intensity across their life cycle 
and offset all remaining emissions. Stellantis’ targets for 2025 
and 2030 focus on short-term emissions reductions and vehicle 
electrification in key markets. They only partially align with the 
1.5°C-aligned sectoral pathways for the automobile industry.

Key developments over the past year: We have identified only 
limited developments and minor updates to Stellantis’ climate 
strategy since the previous analysis was published in February 2023 
(Day, Mooldijk, Hans, et al., 2023). In 2022, Stellantis disclosed its 
full global scope 3 emissions, whereas it previously only published 
partial scope 3 emissions for Europe in 2021. Furthermore, 
Stellantis no longer makes neutrality claims for its scope 1 and 2 
emissions for its South American production facility in Goiania. 
Stellantis has further clarified the phrasing of both its overarching 
2030 target across the entire value chain emissions and its carbon 
net-zero target by 2038, specifying that they are intensity targets 
instead of absolute reduction targets. 

Stellantis commits to an ambitious overarching 2030 target to 
reduce its emissions intensity across the vehicle life cycle by 
50% along the entire value chain compared to 2021 levels. The 
company plans to achieve this target based on several sub-targets 
for different emission sources: vehicle production, the vehicle use 
phase, and its supply chain (Stellantis, 2023a, pp. 59, 60–61). For 
emissions from the vehicle use phase, the company aims to sell 
100% battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for passenger cars in Europe 
and 50% BEVs for passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the US 
by 2030. These two key markets were responsible for 45% and 
31% of the company’s sales in 2022, respectively. While Stellantis’ 
target for the European market aligns with the 1.5°C-aligned 
decarbonisation milestones, its targets for the US market and 
aspirational sales shares for Brazil, India, and China, as outlined in 
its strategic blueprint Dare Forward 2030 (Stellantis, 2022), do not 
(see detailed assessment in the Annex II).

Stellantis has not signed the clean-vehicle pledge announced at COP26 
in November 2021, in which competing automakers from several 

countries, including the US and Germany, committed to exclusively 
producing electric vehicles by 2035 at the latest to support limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C (COP26 Presidency, 2021).

Stellantis’ emissions reduction measures emphasise a rapid 
transition towards electric mobility, but the company continues to 
invest in the development of other technologies, such as e-fuels, 
hydrogen-based fuel cells, and biofuels with highly uncertain 
efficiency and sustainability. To support the electrification of its 
vehicle fleet as part of its effort to reduce downstream scope 3 
emissions, Stellantis implements several vehicle charging solutions. 
For example, Stellantis is investing in the development of a public 
fast charging network slated to operate 35,000 fast chargers by 
2030 across Southern Europe, with additional undisclosed numbers 
in North America (Stellantis, 2023a, pp. 39–40). The company also 
invests in measures to reduce emissions in the vehicle use phase. 
These include enhancing fuel efficiency in existing combustion 
engine vehicle lines, exploring alternative fuels like e-fuel produced 
with hydrogen energy, and hydrogen-based fuel cells for vehicle 
propulsion. However, these latter two drive technologies would 
require significantly more renewable electricity production 
compared to BEVs (Transport & Environment, 2018).

Stellantis remains vague on specific measures to decarbonise 
its upstream scope 3 emissions from sourced materials. In 2022, 
the company stated that ‘more than 65% of strategic […] suppliers 
committed to comply with the Paris Agreement’; the company 
aims to increase this share to 95% by 2030 (Stellantis, 2023a, 
p. 62). The company also plans to increase the share of so-called
‘green materials’ in its vehicles, aiming to launch the first vehicles
containing 25% of them by 2025 (Stellantis, 2023a, p. 51). Stellantis
defines green materials as recycled materials, materials of natural
origin, and bio-sourced materials but remains vague on specific
underlying definitions (Stellantis, 2023a, p. 329). While Stellantis
introduces a higher-level approach to address its upstream supply
chain emissions alongside its target to cut the carbon footprint of
purchased parts for its BEV by 40% by 2030 (Stellantis, 2023a, p. 64), 
the company has yet to disclose specific information on intended
measures and procurement targets for low-carbon steel and other
emission-intensive materials (Stellantis, 2023a, pp. 125–127).

Stellantis aims to achieve ‘carbon net zero’ across its value chain 
by 2038 while limiting the use of offsets to less than 10% of its 
2021 emissions. As part of this commitment, the company commits 

to reducing its emissions intensity across its vehicles’ life cycles by at 
least 90% compared to 2021 (Stellantis, 2023a, pp. 62–63). Stellantis 
plans to offset the remaining emissions through carbon dioxide 
removals and other offsetting solutions. The company remains in 
the process to developing its offsetting strategy carbon including the 
selection of adequate carbon removal technologies (Stellantis, 2023a, p. 
64). 

In a departure from its stance in 2021, Stellantis no longer claims 
that it offsets current scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Brazilian plant 
in Goiania. It also seems that Stellantis is no longer procuring carbon 
credits from projects such as energy generation from landfill waste, 
reforestation, and  environmental restoration efforts (Stellantis, 
2023a, p. 115). Instead, Stellantis continues to provide financial 
support for climate actions beyond its immediate value chain 
without asserting the neutralisation of its own emissions. This is 
reflected in its adoption of a climate contributions approach through 
initiatives to support and restore biodiversity (Stellantis, 2023a, p. 
401). However, we could not identify any information on the extent 
of these contributions. 

Stellantis currently relies mainly on lower-quality RECs to claim 
a share of 27% renewables in its electricity consumption. The 
company surpassed its 2025 target of reaching 50% decarbonized 
electricity by 2025, reporting a share of 55% in 2022. However, the 
company does not clearly define what it means by ‘decarbonized’ 
electricity, which could include renewables, nuclear, and potentially 
other lower carbon technologies (Stellantis, 2023a, p. 124). Its 
renewable electricity consumption accounted for only 27% of its 
total electricity consumption in 2022 (Stellantis, 2023, p. 113). 
With no specific renewable electricity target set, its goal to achieve 
100% decarbonized electricity by 2030 does not guarantee a 
high share of renewable electricity (Stellantis, 2023a, p. 48). The 
company currently procures most of its renewable electricity 
through lower-quality RECs, likely with limited impact on fostering 
additional new renewable generation capacity (Stellantis, 2023a, 
p. 114). Alongside RECs, the company procures less than 2% of 
its renewable electricity through higher-quality PPAs and its own 
on-site generation capacity (Stellantis, 2023, p. 114). The company 
does not disclose further information on the procurement 
constructs it plans to rely on in the future to meet its 100%
decarbonized electricity target in 2030 (Stellantis, 2023a, p. 113).

This page was updated in August 2024: 
The transparency rating for Toyota's short-term target was changed from Moderate to Reasonable.



Toyota
Toyota Motor Corporation (hereafter: Toyota) is one of the world’s 
largest manufacturers of motor vehicles. Most of the company’s 
emissions footprint derives from the use of its sold cars, vans, 
trucks, and buses (79% of 2022 emissions) and from sourced 
materials such as steel (20%). Toyota’s climate strategy is critically 
undermined by a general lack of transparency and specificity in its 
emission disclosure, emissions reduction measures and pledges. 
Toyota’s plans for light- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification fall 
significantly short of 1.5 °C-aligned decarbonisation milestones 
for the automobile industry.
 
Key developments over the past year: We could identify only 
minor changes to Toyota’s climate strategy since the company was 
previously analysed as part of the ‘Assessing Net Zero – Integrity 
Review of 10 Japanese Companies’ report, published in May 2023, 
using the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2022 methodology 
(Odawara and Hirata, 2023, pp. 35–37). Accordingly, differences 
in evaluation mainly result from the further development of our 
methodology and evaluation criteria (NewClimate Institute, 2024).

Toyota’s headline and scope-specific carbon neutrality pledges 
for 2050 remain unsubstantiated as the company provides 
no information on the extent to which it will reduce its own 
emissions. Apart from vague references to the Paris Agreement’s 
temperature limit (for example reference in Toyota, 2023b, p. 23), 
the company does not explain how its 2050 carbon neutrality 
pledges align with key 1.5°C-compatible decarbonisation 
milestones for the automobile industry (see detailed assessment in 
Annex II). The company does not disclose any further information 
on the extent to which it will reduce its own emissions by 2050 as 
part of this pledge and only vaguely communicates its intention to 
rely on carbon credits by an undefined amount to meet its 2050 
target (Toyota, 2023b, p. 45).

The interim targets for 2030 and 2035 do not include commitments 
to phase out internal combustion engines for light-duty vehicles 
in key markets by 2030 or shortly thereafter, falling significantly 
short of 1.5°C-aligned climate action in the automobile sector. 
Only for the European Union and the United Kingdom, Toyota has 
set a target to reach a 50% sales share of electric light-duty vehicles 
by 2030 and to only sell zero-emission vehicles by 2035 (Toyota 

Europe, 2021, 2023a, 2023b, p. 5). However, this targeted sales 
share for 2030 merely reflects the automobile sector’s business-as-
usual development for Europe, rather than the 1.5°C-compatible 
climate ambition going beyond this. The IEA estimates that the 
EV sales share for Europe will reach around 50% under its stated 
policies and announced pledges scenario (IEA, 2023b, p. 114), 
while electric light-duty vehicle sales for Europe and other key 
markets should reach 95%–100% by 2030 to stay below the Paris 
Agreement’s warming limit of 1.5°C (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 
2021, pp. 10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4). We cannot not identify 
any such targets for other key markets for light-duty vehicles such 
as Japan, the United States or China. Toyota’s Chairman Akio 
Toyoda as recently as January 2024 states that Toyota will reach 
not more than 30% of electric vehicles in total sales (Takahashi, 
2024). We cannot identify any specific targets for the phase in of 
zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles by 2030 (see Box 2).

Alongside fully battery electric vehicles, Toyota further invests 
in the development of other technologies with highly uncertain 
efficiency and sustainability as key pillars of its light-duty vehicle 
decarbonisation strategy, such as hydrogen, e-fuels, and biofuels. 
Toyota does not communicate its intended sales share for each of 
those technologies by 2030 or thereafter (Toyota, 2023b, pp. 19, 
22–23, 2023c, p. 6). Recent scientific literature raises concerns on 
energy efficiency and sustainability for all of these technologies to 
effectively and efficiently decarbonise light-duty vehicle transport 
towards 2030 and beyond (Jaramillo et al., 2022, pp. 1064–1071). 
E-fuel produced with hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuel cells, 
for example, would require much greater amounts of renewable 
electricity production than BEVs (Transport & Environment, 
2018). The absence of a specific timeline for the complete phase-
out of internal combustion engines for light-duty vehicles in key 
markets towards 2030 and the promotion of technologies other 
than battery electric vehicles leaves major gaps in Toyota’s climate 
strategy (see detailed assessment in Annex II). 

Toyota has also not signed the non-legally binding COP26 
declaration, which commits to a fully electric fleet by 2035 in 
alignment with the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement as of April 
2024. This is in contrast to competing manufacturers that have 
already signed up to it (COP26 Presidency, 2021; A2Z Coalition, 
2023). Recent analysis also suggests that Toyota's disclosed life-

cycle emissions of sold vehicles are underreported by more than 
60%, primarily due to unrealistic assumptions regarding vehicle 
lifetimes (Bonaccorsi et al., 2022).

Toyota’s climate strategy discloses limited details on its activities 
to reduce emissions from sourced upstream materials such as 
low-carbon steel, despite representing almost one-fifth of its 
emissions across the value chain. For the procurement of low-
carbon steel, for example, Toyota only provides information on 
small-scale pilots for its race-car vehicle production (Toyota, 
2023b, p. 23; W. Liu et al., 2023, p. 13). We could not identify any 
measures or plans aimed at systematically reducing emissions from 
purchased steel and other sourced products. As for the production 
of batteries, Toyota aims to further develop lithium-ion and solid-
state batteries with enhanced performance towards 2026 as part 
of its technological roadmap (Leussink, 2023; Toyota, 2023a, p. 3). 
While in-house battery production would enable Toyota to directly 
influence battery-related emissions by decarbonising its own scope 
1 and 2 emissions, we could not identify any plan or activities to 
reduce these emissions in the future. For the procurement of 
renewable electricity — one of the key levers to reduce emissions 
from battery production — the company provides little information 
on its renewable procurement strategies, despite claiming a 20% 
share of renewable electricity in 2022 and aiming to reach 25% by 
2025 (Toyota, 2023b).

Toyota remains vague on its offsetting strategy to meet its carbon 
neutrality targets for 2035 and 2050. In 2035, Toyota plans to 
offset at least 2.2 MtCO2e to fulfil its carbon neutrality target 
for operational emissions. The company intends to reduce 68% 
of its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 below 2019 levels and 
to offset the remaining 32%  (Toyota, 2023b, p. 45). It is unclear 
to what extent the company plans to rely on carbon credits to 
achieve its 2050 carbon neutrality pledge. The company neither 
communicates the type of carbon credits nor any integrity criteria 
for its future purchases, making these carbon neutrality pledges 
highly ambiguous and contentious. 

79Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Box 1: Analysis of Toyota’s subsidiary 
Hino producing heavy-duty vehicles

Toyota produces heavy-duty trucks and buses through its subsidiary Hino. Hino’s revenue 
of USD 11.5 billion in the financial year of 2023 (April 2022 to March 2023) accounts for 
around 4% of Toyota’s total revenue over the same period (Hino, 2023a, p. 15). Hino’s total 
emissions amount to 41 MtCO2e for 2021 (Hino, 2022, p. 57), of which around 93% originate 
in the use phase of sold heavy-duty vehicles. Toyota does not include these downstream 
emissions from the use of HDVs in its group-wide emissions disclosure (Toyota, 2023b, p. 
47, see footnote 2 of Table A).

The lack of detailed information on base year emissions data or the link between group- and 
subsidiary-level intensity targets raises questions about Hino’s target setting for 2030 and 
beyond. Similar to Toyota’s group-level pledge, Hino’s carbon neutrality target for 2050 lacks 
substantiation, with no information provided on the extent to which the carbon neutrality target 
is to be achieved through emission reductions as opposed to offsetting (Hino, 2022, 2023b). In 
the period leading up to 2030, Toyota and Hino commit to different intensity reduction targets 
for the heavy-duty vehicles’ use phase. Toyota aims for an 11.6% reduction below 2019 levels, 
while Hino targets a 40% reduction below 2013 levels. We could neither identify any explanation 
on how these targets relate to each other nor the disclosure of any base year emissions data 
for Hino’s scope 3 emissions in 2013. Additionally, we cannot identify specific targets for the 
phase-in of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles by 2030, neither at the group level by Toyota 
nor at the subsidiary level by Hino (see detailed assessment in Annex II).

Hino provides limited information on its implemented or planned measures to achieve its 
emission reduction targets. We cannot  identify targets for the phase-in of zero-emission 
heavy-duty vehicles by 2030, nor the expansion of related charging infrastructure (for 
example in Hino, 2022, 2023b). Recent literature indicates that globally 30–37% of heavy-
duty trucks should be battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) by 
2030 to align with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement temperature limit (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; 
Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). Hino also does not communicate 
any information on measures to address emissions related to the procurement of upstream 
materials such as low-carbon steel.

Volkswagen Group

The assessment is based on the 2022 sustainability report; the information in the 2023 
sustainability report published in March 2024 does not lead to any changes in our evaluation.

Volkswagen AG (hereafter: Volkswagen Group) is one of the 
world’s largest manufacturers of motor vehicles. Most of the 
company’s emissions originate in the use phase of its sold 
cars, vans, trucks, and buses (86% of 2022 emissions) and 
from sourced materials such as steel (13%). Over the last 
three years, the company has shown little progress in aligning 
its group-level climate targets with the latest science and 
voluntary standards. The company aims to become carbon 
neutral by 2050 but has not clarified the extent to which it will 
reduce emissions to achieve this pledge. Despite a range of 
emission reduction measures across all scopes, Volkswagen’s 
climate strategy for light-duty vehicle electrification and its 
2030 targets fall short of decarbonisation milestones for the 
automobile industry to be in line with the Paris Agreement’s 
1.5°C global warming limit.

Key developments over the past year: We have identified 
only limited developments and minor updates to Volkswagen’s 
climate strategy since the previous analysis was published in 
February 2023 (Day, Mooldijk, Hans, et al., 2023). In 2023, 
for example, the company increased its targeted share of fully 
electric vehicles sold in Europe from 60% to 70%. Volkswagen 
has neither provided further clarity on its 2050 carbon neutrality 
target nor committed to specific phase-out dates for internal 
combustion engines. A first-time analysis of Volkswagen’s 
subsidiary Traton, which manufactures all of Volkswagen’s 
heavy-duty vehicles, has further revealed that Volkswagen 
does not include any of the scope 3 emissions from heavy-duty 
vehicles in its group-level emissions disclosure.

Volkswagen has shown no progress in enhancing its group-level 
targets, which remain incompatible with the Paris Agreement 
1.5°C temperature limit, and no longer publicly refers to its 2025 
target. Notably, there has been no improvement in providing 
details for Volkswagen’s 2050 carbon neutrality target, initially 
announced in 2019, despite requirements for long-term pledges 
laid out by the UN High-Level Expert Group and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO, 2022; UN HLEG, 2022). 
It remains entirely unclear to what extent the carbon neutrality 
target is to be achieved through emission reductions, as opposed 
to offsetting. The company also lacks any emission reduction 
target for its upstream value chain emissions towards 2030 and 
beyond, despite being responsible for 13% of its 2022 emissions. 

We can no longer find any public reference by Volkswagen to its 
2025 reduction target for vehicle use-phase emission intensity in 
the sustainability reporting of 2023 (Volkswagen, 2023b, 2023a). 
The target aimed at reducing emission intensity by 30% between 
2018 and 2025 was critically undermined by the unspecified role 
of offsetting (see previous assessment in Day, Mooldijk, Hans, 
et al., 2023, pp. 115–116, 159–160). The discontinuation of the 
target, rather than its clarification, would leave the company 
without any tangible emission reduction goal within the next 
five years. Recent analysis further suggests that Volkswagen 
currently underreports its disclosed life-cycle emissions of sold 
vehicles by more than 50% due to unrealistic assumptions on 
vehicle lifetimes (Bonaccorsi et al., 2022, p. 15).

Despite recent integrity issues with carbon credits purchased 
in the voluntary carbon market, Volkswagen’s climate strategy 
continues to rely on offsetting to meet its group-wide carbon 
neutrality target for 2050 and to make present-day carbon 
neutrality claims for production lines. Volkswagen had been 
acquiring carbon credits from the Kariba mega-project in 
Zimbabwe. In 2022 alone, the company purchased carbon credits 
of around 1.1 MtCO2e from this project (Volkswagen, 2023a), 
representing roughly 20% of the total 5.9 MtCO2e purchased 
that year. However, the Swiss project developer South Pole, who 
ran the Kariba mega-project, decided to terminate and withdraw 
from the project entirely in October 2023 following allegations 
of inflated climate benefits and issues related to due diligence 
(Elgin and White, 2023). This case underscores the inherent risks 
associated with offsetting practices relying on carbon credits to 
offset rather than reduce emissions along the companies’ value 
chain (see Section 3.1). Besides purchasing carbon credits in the 
voluntary carbon market, Volkswagen formed a joint venture 
with Climate Partner in 2022 to develop its own projects for 
issuing carbon credits from biological carbon dioxide removal. 
The companies have not yet provided any further information 
on the scope and timeline of its future activities (Volkswagen 
ClimatePartner, 2024).

Volkswagen does not commit to the phaseout of internal 
combustion engines for light-duty vehicles sold in key markets 
by 2030, significantly falling short of 1.5°C-aligned climate 
action in the automobile sector. Volkswagen increased its 
targeted share for electric light-duty vehicles sold in Europe by 
2030 from 60% to 70%, while continuing to commit to at least 
a 50% share in China and the US (Volkswagen, 2023c, p. 8). In 
these main markets, electric light-duty vehicles sales should 
reach 95%–100% by 2030 to stay below the Paris Agreement’s 
warming limit of 1.5°C (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 
10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4). The absence of a specific timeline 
for the complete phaseout of internal combustion engines for 
key markets towards 2030 or shortly thereafter leaves major 
gaps in the company’s climate strategy (see detailed assessment 
in Annex II). Unlike some other automobile manufacturers in the 
US or Germany, Volkswagen has also not signed the COP26 
declaration committing to only sell electric vehicles by 2035 to 
support achieving the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement as 
of April 2024 (COP26 Presidency, 2021; A2Z Coalition, 2023). 
Despite the shortcomings of Volkswagen’s targets for light-duty 
vehicles, sales targets for heavy-duty zero-emission vehicles by 
2030 do meet the 1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible milestones 
for most of Volkswagen’s brands (see Box 1).

The climate strategy provides limited details on the scope, 
timeline, and indented impact of Volkswagen’s activities 
to reduce emissions of purchased upstream materials 
such as steel and batteries. Volkswagen, for example, has 
signed a memorandum of understanding with steel producer 
Salzgitter to become one of its first customers of low-CO2 
steel. The company also plans to set binding CO2 targets for 
suppliers of upstream materials, such as battery manufacturers 
(Volkswagen, 2023b, pp. 42–43; W. Liu et al., 2023, p. 14). 
Despite these steps in the right direction, the lack of details 
and specific milestones hinders an independent assessment of 
their level of ambition and comprehensiveness.

82Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Volkswagen produces heavy-duty trucks and buses through its subsidiary Traton. Traton manages 
four different vehicle brands: Scania, MAN, Navistar, and Volkswagen Truck & Bus. In 2022, 
Traton generated revenue of EUR 40.3 billion in 2022 (ca. USD 42.5 billion), accounting for 
around 14% of Volkswagen Group’s total revenue for the same year (Traton, 2023b).

Traton does not disclose consolidated up- and downstream scope 3 emissions across its four 
brands. The annual emissions from the use-phase of sold heavy-duty vehicles might be way 
higher than 300 MtCO2e considering the most recently published sustainability reports by each 
of the four brands (MAN, 2023, p. 17; Navistar, 2023, p. 56; Scania, 2023, p. 156; Volkswagen 
Truck & Bus, 2023, p. 137). As of April 2024, the Volkswagen Group does not include any of 
the scope 3 emission for its four heavy-duty vehicles' brands in its annual emissions disclosure. 
Traton only reports consolidated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (Traton, 2023a, p. 29).

Traton’s brand-level targets for selling zero-emission vehicles by 2030 mostly align with 1.5°C 
Paris Agreement-compatible milestones for heavy-duty vehicles by 2030. While Traton does 
not set any group-level emission reduction targets across all heavy-duty vehicle brands, each 
individual brand commits to its own targets (Traton, 2023a, pp. 17–20). MAN, Scania and 
Navistar International Cooperation — covering 26 out of Volkswagen Group’s 28 production 
sites for heavy-duty vehicles — all pledge to reach a minimum 40% sales share for heavy-duty 
zero-emission vehicles by 2030 (Traton, 2023a, p. 17). These commitments are in line with 
the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-compatible decarbonisation milestones for heavy duty trucks. 
Scania (net-zero carbon by 2040) and MAN (greenhouse gas neutral by 2050) additionally 
commit to net-zero targets under the SBTi Net Zero Standard (Traton, 2023a, p. 12). As with 
Volkswagen Group’s overarching carbon neutrality target, we were unable to identify any post-
2040 emission reduction target by the two brands alongside the subsidiary-level net-zero and 
carbon neutrality pledges

Traton and its brands have started to implement measures to support the roll-out of charging 
infrastructure and reduce emissions of upstream materials, although uncertainties regarding 
their scope and intended impact remain. Scania, for example, commits to procuring “100% 
green batteries, green steel, green aluminium, and green cast iron in its European production 
by 2030”. The commitment lacks specificity on how much it aims to reduce emissions versus 
relying on offsetting to meet this claim (Traton, 2023a, p. 13). As a member of The First 
Mover Coalition, Scania also aims to procure at least 10% of low-carbon steel and aluminium 
by 2030 (FMC, 2022c, 2022a). However, the effectiveness of these steps in achieving the 
claimed ‘100% green’ procurement of zero-emission steel or aluminium remains uncertain. 
It is also unclear to what extent the cooperation between Scania and H2 Green Steel will 
cover Scania’s steel demand in 2023 (Volkswagen, 2023b, p. 43). Traton also contributes to 
the establishment of charging infrastructure, with more than 1,700 public charging points 
in Europe as part of its joint venture that involves a EUR 0.5 billion investment, alongside 
Daimler Truck and Volvo Group (Traton, 2023a, p. 18).

Volvo Group

The assessment is based on the 2022 sustainability report; the information in the 2023 
sustainability report published in March 2024 does not lead to any changes in our evaluation.

Note to readers: This assessment exclusively focuses on the 
climate strategy of AB Volvo as a producer of heavy-duty vehicles. 
It does not assess the business activities and climate strategy of 
the Volvo Car Group, which produces light-duty vehicles. The two 
companies operate independently of each other, despite sharing 
the Volvo brand name.

AB Volvo (hereafter: Volvo Group) is one of the world’s 
largest manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks, 
buses, industrial and marine engines. Most of the company’s 
emissions originate from the use phase of its vehicles and 
engines (96% of 2022 emissions) and from sourced materials 
such as steel (~4%). The company commits to ambitious targets 
and measures to phase in zero-emission vehicles leading up 
to 2030. Its climate strategy also introduces the first credible 
steps to address emissions from the upstream value chain. 
However, the Volvo Group’s plans for climate action beyond 
2030 lack transparency and specificity.

Volvo Group transparently discloses its operational and use 
phase emissions of sold vehicles, while reporting on all other 
emissions in the up- and downstream value chain is still 
under development. An explorative analysis conducted by 
the company estimates that emissions in the upstream value 
chain — such as those from the sourcing of steel, aluminium, 
and other materials — accounted for approximately 4% of total 
emissions in 2022 (Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 23, 154–155, 177). 
No further explorative analysis of a similar kind has been done 
for other downstream value chain emissions, such as those 
associated with the end-of-life treatment of sold vehicles. For 
this reason, we estimate Volvo Group’s total emissions to be at 
least 299 MtCO2 in 2022, but likely higher if other categories 
not estimated currently were to be included.

The company’s transparent and ambitious targets towards 
2030 put a distinct focus accelerating the needed phase in 
of zero-emission vehicles in this crucial period for the global 
efforts to limit climate change. For this period, the company 
sets vehicle type-specific reduction targets for use-phase 
emissions (Volvo Group, 2023a, p. 151), including intensity 
targets for heavy-duty trucks and buses, and absolute 
reduction targets for construction equipment, industrial, and 
marine engines. In addition, the target to sell “at least” 35% of 

electric vehicles by 2030 across all vehicle types globally meets 
the 1.5°C-compatible benchmarks for heavy-duty trucks, 
which accounted for 66% of Volvo Group’s revenue in 2022 
(Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 16, 151). However, for buses, which 
represented 4% of Volvo Group’s revenue in 2022, the sales 
share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric 
vehicles (FCEVs) must reach between 56–60% by 2030 globally 
and 100% by 2030 in advanced economies and China (see 
detailed assessment in Annex II).

The Volvo Group shows less transparency and specificity for 
the period beyond 2030. While the phase-in of BEVs and 
FCEVs will likely accelerate towards 2040, the company has 
not committed to specific sales targets for this period. Instead, 
it refers to aspirational developments under an “illustrative 
scenario for 1.5°C” (Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 16, 155). The 
company plans for phasing in zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) 
towards 2040 are further called into question as it intends to 
continue selling vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICEs) 
running on biofuels, such as renewable liquid, hydrogenated 
vegetable oil, and biogas to an unspecified extent (Volvo Group, 
2023a, pp. 16, 155). Although Volvo Group acknowledges the 
limited availability of sustainable biofuels (Volvo Group, 2023a, 
p. 158), it does not outline any specific criteria or guidelines to 
ensure the fuels’ sustainability (Volvo Group, 2023b). The use of 
biofuels at scale faces multiple sustainability issues and should 
be avoided if technological alternatives are readily available (see 
more information in Section 3.5).

Comprehensive measures support the phase-in of electric 
vehicles by 2030 and take the first credible steps to address 
emissions from the upstream value chain. The company 
formed a joint venture together with Traton and Daimler Truck 
jointly investing EUR 0.5 billion to roll out a high-performance 
public charging network for battery electric trucks and coaches 
(Volvo Group, 2023a, p. 35). The company also invests in the 
R&D and the expansion of own production capacities for 
batteries and hydrogen fuel cells (Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 
18–19; 189). To address its upstream value chain emissions, 
Volvo Group is one of the world’s first vehicle manufacturers 
to publicly set procurement targets for low-carbon alternatives 
to production materials like steel. As a founding member of The 
First Mover Coalition, the company commits to sourcing at least 
10% of low-carbon steel and primary aluminium (FMC, 2022c, 

2022a; Volvo Group, 2023a, p. 177). For the purchase of low-
carbon steel, the company entered into supply agreements with 
SSAB in 2021 and with H2 Green Steel starting in 2026 (Volvo 
Group, 2021, 2023c, 2023a). Through these agreements, the 
company produced its first vehicle with zero-carbon steel in 
2021 and began introducing fossil-free steel into parts of its 
vehicle product range in 2022 (Volvo Group, 2023a, p. 33). In 
2023, the company started partnering with Norsk Hydro to 
establish a roadmap for increasing ‘near zero’ aluminium use 
before 2030 and supplying ‘net zero’ aluminium in 2040 (Volvo 
Group, 2024). Volvo Group does not specify what it means by 
near zero or net zero aluminium.

The climate strategy remains unsubstantiated in defining 
Volvo Group’s 2040 net-zero target related to offsetting and 
renewable electricity procurement. The company discloses 
neither the extent to which it will reduce its own emissions 
by 2040 as part of this pledge, nor the amount and type of 
carbon credits it intends to use to claim net zero. Recently 
published guidance on meaningful net-zero target setting 
emphasises both of these aspects (ISO, 2022; UN HLEG, 2022; 
SBTi, 2023d). While Volvo Group might follow The First Mover 
Coalition’s guidelines on “scalable and durable” carbon removal 
solutions  (FMC, 2022b) could not identify any reference to 
this in Volvo’s sustainability reporting. Similarly, the reporting 
provides no detailed information on the company’s renewable 
electricity procurement, despite emphasising the need for 
increased sourcing of renewable energy beyond the 48% 
achieved in 2022 (Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 155–156).

Electric utilities6
6.1 Sector highlights

Table 18 provides a summary overview of our (transparency) and integrity ratings for Iberdrola, 
Enel, ENGIE, Duke Energy, and KEPCO.

Table 18: Overview of integrity ratings for electric utilities.

•	 Electric utilities' emissions are primarily derived from electricity generation, sales 
of fossil gas and the upstream fuel chain (which includes the resale of purchased 
electricity and the extraction, transport, and processing of fuels). The complete phase-
out of fossil fuels and a rapid shift to renewables are the two main levers for electric 
utilities to decarbonise.

•	 Likely driven by regulations, European companies generally demonstrate higher 
ambition than Duke Energy and KEPCO. This is likely driven by legal compliance and 
more stringent regulations adopted in the EU, especially the EU emissions trading 
scheme. Duke Energy and KEPCO's targets fall short of global benchmarks, with a 
delayed phase-out of coal and fossil gas, and inadequate renewable energy targets. None 
of the five electric utilities present a comprehensive strategy for fossil gas phase-out.

•	 Despite mostly operating in advanced economies, none of the assessed companies 
have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2035. Both Iberdrola and Enel aim 
to reach (net) zero emissions by 2040, while ENGIE aims to reach net zero by 2045, and 
Duke Energy and KEPCO by 2050. All assessed companies would need to target net zero 
by 2035 to align their pledges with sectoral and regional benchmarks (IEA, 2023c, p. 79).

•	 Several electric utilities pursue controversial solutions. CC(U)S, bioenergy, and advanced 
nuclear technologies can distract electric utilities from investing in renewable generation 
and supporting electrification in end-use sectors.

•	 Two of the five electric utilities do not clarify to what extent they will rely on offsetting 
to achieve their net-zero targets, while the other three provide limited details on how 
they will neutralise remaining emissions by their net-zero target year. Duke Energy 
and KEPCO do not provide an emission reduction commitment alongside their net-zero 
pledge at all. Enel, Iberdrola, and ENGIE commit to reduce emissions across their value 
chain by 98%, 90% and, 84%, respectively. However, they provide limited details on the 
type of CDR they will use to neutralise their remaining emissions.  None of the companies 
discloses information on climate contributions beyond the value chain.

6.2 Sectoral transition framework
Approximately three-quarters of global emissions are linked 
to energy, with 40% of this attributed to electricity and 
heat generation. Currently, the power sector is dominated 
by fossil fuels, with coal alone accounting for nearly 40% 
of global electricity generation (Ritchie and Rosado, 2020; 
Climate Watch and World Resources Institute, 2022). In order 
for other sectors to fully decarbonise, it is necessary that 
the power sector switches to renewable generation within 
the next two decades, and earlier in advanced economies. 
Electricity's share of final energy consumption is anticipated 
to surge from 20% today to over 50% by 2050 (IEA, 2023c, 
p. 79). End-use sectors, like transport, buildings, and certain 
industries like textiles and food, are expected to electrify in 
their efforts to decarbonise. Furthermore, electricity paves 
the way for decarbonisation in sectors that are difficult to 
electrify, like chemicals, steel, and aviation, by facilitating 
the production of green hydrogen (Henderson et al., 2020, 
p. 14; IRENA, 2023a, p. 16).

Aligning with the 1.5°C pathway requires a steep and 
immediate reduction in both absolute emissions and carbon 
intensity.  According to the IEA Net Zero Report, aligning the 
energy sector with a 1.5°C-compatible pathway requires a 44% 
emissions reduction globally in 2030 compared to 2021(IEA, 
2023c, p. 79). Correspondingly, the global power sector will 
have to reduce its emission intensity to 48-186 gCO2/kWh 
by 2030, and 0-23 gCO2/kWh by 2040 (Dietz, Gardiner, et 
al., 2021, p. 7; Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; CAT, 2023b, p. 20; 
IEA, 2023c, p. 199). This can be achieved by increasing the 
share of low-carbon energy sources, particularly renewables, 
and phasing out carbon-intensive fossil fuels (IPCC, 2022, 
p. 8). Under the 1.5°C-compatible trajectory, the electricity 
sector is required to be the first to achieve net zero — by 
2035 for advanced economies, by 2040 for China, and by 
2045 for the rest of the world (IEA, 2023c, p. 79). By 2050, 
it is anticipated that the electric utilities will not only have 
zero carbon emissions but also employ negative emissions 
technologies to achieve a state of negative carbon intensity 
(Dietz, Gardiner, et al., 2021, p. 7; Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; 
IEA, 2023c, p. 199).

Decarbonising the power sector is not only technically 
feasible, but also economically viable and environmentally 
beneficial. In many countries, renewable energy has become 
the most cost-effective option for generating power due to 
its declining costs, which have fallen below the fossil fuel 
cost range (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 33; IRENA, 2023b, p. 36). 
Over the past decade, the weighted average levelized cost of 
electricity (LCOE) for solar PV have dropped by 80%, onshore 
wind by 65%, and offshore wind by 54%. Additionally, the 
cost of short-duration energy storage is also falling rapidly, 
reaching around 89% between 2010 and 2021, and is 
expected to decrease even further (Ladislaw and Naimoli, 
2020, p. 2; BloombergNEF, 2022; Boehm et al., 2023, p. 
33; Cole and Karmakar, 2023, p. 4). As a sector with the 
most advanced and readily available technological options 
for mitigation, electric utilities need not continue relying 
on fossil fuel-based generation systems in the medium and 
long term, which entail expensive social and environmental 
externalities (CAT, 2016, p. 7; IRENA, 2016, p. 7).

Electric utilities’ climate strategies ought to avoid false 
technological solutions on the path to climate neutrality. 
Such solutions include the use of bioenergy, the use of CC(U)
S, and the transfer (or sale) of polluting infrastructure to other 
companies. Bioenergy production is associated with a range 
of sustainability issues, including deforestation, biodiversity 
loss, uncertain GHG emissions reductions, and food insecurity 
(see Section 3.3 of this report and Section 3 of the methodology 
document). The scarcity of sustainable bioenergy resources 
means that they should only be used in sectors where 
there are limited alternatives, which is not the case for the 
electricity utility sector (ETC, 2021, p. 62). Regarding CC(U)
S, benchmarks indicate that this technology can only have a 
very minimal role in a decarbonised power sector, and only 
for gas power plants (CAT, 2023b, p. 10). CC(U)S extend the 
lifetime of fossil fuel and is a distraction from investing in true 
solutions. In addition, CC(U)S is faced with high challenges 
such as a high energy demand, imperfect capture rates, 
scarcity of storage potential, and very high costs compared 
to the costs of renewables and energy storage.

Key actions and measures for electric utilities 
Measures to address electricity generation and its associated emissions along the value chain (scope 1 and/or upstream scope 3) 

The primary source of emissions for electric utilities typically stem from electricity generation and its associated emissions along the value chain. Depending on the company's structure and 
business model, these emissions can be categorised under either scope 1 or upstream scope 3 (category 3). Collectively, these sources typically account for more than three quarters of the 
emissions profile of electric utilities.

Phase out of coal, oil, and gas for electricity and heat generation    Critical transitional measure
Global

•	 All (unabated) coal-fired power plants must be phased 
out globally by 2040 (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; CAT, 
2023b, p. 1; IEA, 2023c, p. 92). 

•	 All large oil-fired power plants must be fully phased out 
globally by 2040 (IEA, 2023c, p. 92).

•	 All unabated fossil gas-fired power plants must be 
phased out globally by 2040, with a minimal role for 
CC(U)S (CAT, 2023b, p. 1). Fossil gas should constitute 
less than 5% of electricity generation by 2040, reducing 
further to 0-1% by 2050 (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; CAT, 
2023b, p. 12; IEA, 2023c, p. 92).

Advanced economies

•	 All unabated coal-fired power plants must be phased 
out in advanced economies by 2030 (CAT, 2023b, p. 
1; IEA, 2023c, p. 92). 

•	 All unabated fossil gas-fired power plants must be 
phased out in advanced economies by 2035, with a 
minimal role for CC(U)S (CAT, 2023b, p. 1).

Phasing out fossil fuels represents the most important measure 
for decarbonising electricity to prevent investing in assets that 
will become stranded and locking in emissions that will derail 
us from staying in a 1.5°C trajectory (IEA, 2023c). Achieving 
this measure requires electric utilities to comply with the 
following milestones: 

Scale up renewables rapidly    Critical transitional measure

The acceleration of renewable energy adoption is the second 
key pillar in achieving steep reduction in carbon intensity, with 
a decarbonisation pathway that may vary based on regional 
differences (for detailed figures on the share of renewables in 
electricity generation milestones for certain countries, see CAT 
(2023b, p. 16). To align with a 1.5°C trajectory, electric utilities 
must ensure for operations that meet these benchmarks:

•	 Renewables should constitute between 59–89% in 
global electricity generation by 2030, 85–97% by 2040, 
and 89–100% by 2050 (IEA, 2022b, p. 138, 2023c, p. 
197; Teske, 2022, p. 296; Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; 
CAT, 2023b, p. 16; IRENA, 2023c, pp. 22, 75). Variable 
renewable (wind and solar) will comprise between 40–
78% in global electricity generation by 2030, 66–91% by 
2040, and 70–96% by 2050 (IEA, 2022b, p. 138, 2023c, 
p. 197; Teske, 2022, p. 296; Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; 
IRENA, 2023c, pp. 22, 75).  

•	 Renewables need to account for 68–77% of total 
installed capacity by 2030 and 82–94% by 2050, with 
higher shares in advanced economies (IEA, 2023c, p. 
197; IRENA, 2023c, pp. 22, 75). Annual addition of 
variable renewable (wind and solar) capacity should 
reach approximately 1,100 GW by 2030, almost 
four times greater than the capacity added in 2022 
(around 300 GW) (IEA, 2022b, p. 138, 2023c, p. 197; 
IRENA, 2023c, pp. 22, 75). China, the EU, and the 
United States are expected to account for 75% of this 
annual capacity addition.

88Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Improve power system reliability and flexibility    Enabling measure

Improving grid reliability and flexibility is a prerequisite to 
allow higher penetration of renewables, given the variable 
nature of wind and solar energy, alongside the increasing 
demands of electrification, which reshapes load curves and 
boosts demand variability (IEA, 2022b, pp. 214–216; Jafari 
et al., 2022). According to IEA (IEA, 2023a, pp. 7-9,27,42-
44,51,90,102-105, 2023c, p. 80) and IRENA (2023c, p. 152), 
grid expansion and improvement is crucial to effectively 
integrate an increasing amount of renewable sources while 
ensuring supply security and enhancing resilience against 
extreme weather events. Currently, over 3,000 GW of 
renewable power projects, half of which are in advanced 
stages, are awaiting grid connection. This backlog highlights 
the risk of the grid becoming a significant bottleneck in the 
energy transition. In addition, the process of developing new 

grid infrastructure can take up to 15 years, from planning 
to commissioning, in contrast to an average of 5 years for 
renewable projects. In advanced economies such as the 
EU, the US, and South Korea, delays in grid development 
could lead to increased reliance on fossil gas beyond 
2030, potentially making energy less affordable and more 
susceptible to price volatility due to dependence on coal 
and fossil gas. This underscores the urgency for electric 
utilities, especially those owning transmission and distribution 
operations, to invest significantly in grid expansion and 
improvement in the short-term, in line with the scale required 
to meet these benchmarks:

•	 Grid investments are expected to double by 2030, 
rising from around USD 300 billion in 2022 to 
USD 680 billion, with a focus on digitalisation and 
modernisation of distribution systems (IEA, 2023e, p. 
49, 2023c, pp. 80, 107, 146). By 2030, transmission 
and distribution grids will need to expand by 2 million 
kilometres annually to reach approximately 90 million 
kilometres in total.

•	 As battery storage emerges as an important option for 
grid flexibility in systems with a high share of variable 
renewables, it is anticipated that global utility-scale 
battery capacity will reach approximately 1,000 GW 
by 2030 and could exceed 4,000 GW by 2050 (IEA, 
2022b, pp. 215–216, 2023c, pp. 83, 197). 

Measures to address emissions from the sale of fossil gas (downstream scope 3) 

Depending on the business model, another significant source of emissions for electric utility companies typically stems from the sale of fossil gas. This is categorised under downstream scope 
3 (category 11). In line with the previous measures, electric utilities should actively facilitate the switch from fossil fuels to cleaner energy alternatives for the end-use sectors. This not only 
supports the broader industry transition but also directly addresses the primary emissions sources, which predominantly arise from fossil-based electricity generation and sales of fossil gas.

Support electrification and alternatives in other sectors    Enabling measure

Transitioning from fossil fuels to electricity and lower-carbon fuel 
alternatives like green hydrogen in end-use sectors is one of the 
identified measures to align with the 1.5° pathway (IPCC, 2022, 
p. 29). Deep electrification of end-use sectors has the potential 
to cut emissions by 20–25% in buildings, 50–60% in transport, 
and 15–20% in industries (IRENA, 2019, pp. 6–7; Nadel, 2019). 
This is especially evident in applications such as heat pumps, 
electric light-duty vehicles, and low-to-medium temperature 
industrial processes. Complementarily, green hydrogen serves as 
a solution to overcome the limits of electrification to decarbonise 
the sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as chemicals, 
shipping, aviation, and high-temperature applications in the 
iron and steel industry (The Hydrogen Council and McKinsey & 
Company, 2021, pp. 13–17; Lorentz et al., 2023, p. 9). The role 
of electric utilities can be pivotal in this transition, taking the lead 

in infrastructure investments and promoting partnerships, such 
as by scaling up green hydrogen production facilities, investing 
in EV charging infrastructure, or promoting the adoption of heat 
pumps for customers, which contributes to meet the following 
Paris-aligned benchmarks: 

•	 Investments in clean hydrogen (mostly green hydrogen) 
and its derivatives infrastructure currently stand at 
approximately USD 1 billion annually in 2022 and need 
to increase to USD 100–150 billion annually by 2030 
and USD 170 billion annually by 2050 (IEA, 2023c, p. 
141; IRENA, 2023c, p. 23).

•	 Electrolyser capacity needs to be scaled up from 0.5 GW 
in 2022 to 428 GW by 2030 and 5,722 GW by 2050 
(IRENA, 2023c, p. 23).

•	 Annual green hydrogen production must be ramped 
up from 0.03 million tonne in 2021, to 58 million 
tonne by 2030 and 330 million tonne by 2050 
(Boehm et al., 2023, p. 61).

•	 Investments for EV charging infrastructure and 
adoption support currently stand at USD 30 billion 
per year in 2022, and need to reach USD 137 billion 
per year by 2030 and USD 364 billion per year by 
2050 (IRENA, 2023c, p. 23).

•	 Investments in heat pumps, presently at USD 64 billion 
per year in 2022, needs to rise to USD 237 billion per 
year by 2030 and USD 230 billion per year by 2050 
(IRENA, 2023c, p. 23).

6.2 Duke Energy

90Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Duke Energy
Duke Energy Corporation, headquartered in the United States, is 
a major energy holding company operating in six federal states. 
It specialises in the generation, transmission, and distribution of 
electricity, as well as the storage, transmission, and distribution 
of fossil gas. In 2022, two-thirds of its emissions originated from 
electricity generation, while a quarter comes from the upstream 
fuel chain, which includes the resale of purchased electricity and 
the extraction, transport, and processing of fuels. Over 60% of 
the company’s electricity generation capacity derived from coal 
and fossil gas in 2022. Duke Energy committed to achieving net-
zero emissions by 2050 and set short- and medium-term goals. 
However, insufficient renewable energy targets, a delayed coal 
phase-out, and the risk of over-reliance on fossil gas undermine 
these climate targets. Duke’s climate strategy falls short of 
decarbonisation milestones for electric utilities needed to align 
with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C global warming limit.

Duke Energy’s emission reduction target for 2030 is 
insufficient to contribute to the deep emission reductions 
required for the power sector by that year. The company aims 
to reduce its scope 1 emissions by at least 50% below 2005 
levels by 2030 (Duke Energy, 2023b, p. 17, 2023a, p. 65), 
which translates to only a 14% reduction below 2019 levels. 
Not only is this short-term target insufficient, but Duke Energy 
had already managed to reduce its scope 1 emissions by 44% 
below 2005 levels in 2022, indicating that the company needs 
to undertake only minimal additional efforts to reach its 2030 
target of 50% reduction in scope 1 emissions (Duke Energy, 
2023b, p. 16). As part of this 50% reduction commitment, Duke 
Energy pledged to achieve net-zero methane emissions from 
natural gas distribution (scope 1). However, the energy utility 
provides no further details on this commitment, including the 
expected role of offsetting versus own emission reductions. 

Duke Energy’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions 
by 2050 does not meet the timelines required for electric 
utilities in advanced economies, which need to reach net 
zero by 2035 (IEA, 2023c). As milestones on the pathway to 
net zero, Duke Energy commits to reducing its scope 2 and 
selected scope 3 emissions by 50% below 2021 levels by 2035, 
and to reducing its scope 1 carbon emissions by 80% below 
2005 levels by 2040 (Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 65). Neither these 
interim targets nor the 2050 net-zero pledge meet sectoral 

and regional benchmarks, which require power utilities in the 
United States to achieve net zero between 2035 and 2040 
(CAT, 2023b, p. 1; IEA, 2023c, p. 62). While Duke specifies that 
it will offset part of its emissions to get to net-zero emissions, 
the company provides no details on the amount of emissions 
it plans to offset or the type of offsetting projects it plans to 
pursue (Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 53). Moreover, Duke Energy’s 
publications frequently underscore that achieving its climate 
targets hinges on external factors, such as regulatory approvals, 
enabling policies, and technology advancements (Duke Energy, 
2023a, p. 48,52,71). This emphasis indicates a potentially 
passive approach to accelerating climate action, despite the 
company’s significant role in the energy sector.

Duke Energy’s approach to phasing out coal-fired and 
gas-fired electricity generation does not align with the 
1.5°C-compatible benchmarks for the sector, and creates 
risks of increased reliance on fossil gas and related stranded 
assets. Duke Energy plans to reduce its coal generation to 5% 
of the mix by 2030 and to phase out coal completely by 2035, 
but with the caveat that these targets are subject to regulatory 
approvals (Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 29). This timeline lags behind 
the 1.5 °C-compatible phase-out timeline of 2030 for advanced 
economies (CAT, 2023b, p. 1; IEA, 2023c, p. 62). Despite its 
emissions reduction commitment, Duke Energy does not plan 
to halt fossil gas-fired power plant construction after 2030, 
but instead relies on anticipated hydrogen capabilities and 
hydrogen blending in gas turbines (Duke Energy, 2022, p. 18,67, 
2023a, p. 43), which could potentially lead to stranded assets 
in the future. Duke Energy is in the process of converting about 
one-third of its coal units to run fully or partially on fossil gas, 
with certain units expected to run fully on fossil gas beyond the 
designated coal plant phase-out year (Duke Energy, 2022, p. 
60). The company only sets a goal to phase out its gas-powered 
generation portfolio by 2050 (Duke Energy, 2023a, pp. 48–49), 
which is 15 years beyond the advised timeline for developed 
countries (CAT, 2023b, p. 1). 

Instead of rapidly increasing the share of renewable energy 
deployment, Duke Energy plans to incorporate false solutions 
like CCUS and biogas. In 2022, renewable energy accounted 
for only 8% of Duke Energy’s total electricity generation (Duke 
Energy, 2023b, p. 22). The company’s renewable targets in its 
generation mix — 18% by 2030, 35% by 2040, and 40% by 

2050 — fall far short of 1.5 °C-compatible sectoral benchmarks 
in the United States, which suggest a renewable mix of 68%–
86% by 2030, 85%–95% by 2035, 93%–97% by 2040, and 
99%–100% by 2050 (Duke Energy, 2022, p. 18, 2023b, p. 22, 
2023a, p. 20; CAT, 2023b, p. 16). At the same time, the company 
considers resorting to CCUS for its coal-fired power plants and 
combined cycle power plants (Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 37,44). 
Reliance on CCUS in electricity generation faces severe risks 
due to the unproven efficacy of these technologies and their 
potential environmental impacts. Duke Energy also regards 
renewable natural gas (RNG) from waste-based feedstocks as 
a ‘carbon neutral’ fuel (Duke Energy, 2023b, p. 31), potentially 
overlooking the fuel’s negative sustainability implications while 
diverting attention from the need to invest in real solutions 
(Saadat et al., 2020). The investment in RNG might prolong 
the use of fossil gas infrastructure rather than representing a 
genuine pivot towards more sustainable alternatives, such as 
renewables-based electrification.

Enel
Enel is an international energy based in Italy. Most of the 
company’s emissions originate from electricity production 
and heat (39%), sales of gas (17%), and the upstream fuel 
chain (29%), which includes the purchase of electricity and 
the extraction and transport of coal and gas. The company 
aims to achieve net-zero emissions in 2040. This commitment 
translates to a 98% reduction of all emissions below 2019 
levels. Enel commits to phasing out coal by 2027 and gas by 
2040. The company’s strategy lays the groundwork for a new 
business model focused on renewable energy generation and 
the electrification of customers in the building and mobility 
sectors. Overall, Enel’s climate strategy is mostly aligned with 
the 1.5° pathway for the power sector for both 2030 and 2040.

Enel’s 2030 intensity targets represent a step in the right 
direction but should be enhanced to meet decarbonisation 
benchmarks for Europe. The company commits to reducing 
the carbon intensity of power generation (scope 1) to 72 
gCO2e/kWh and integrated power (from both own electricity 
generation and electricity purchased) to 73 gCO2e/kWh 
power by 2030 (Enel, 2023a, pp. 88–89). While these targets 
fall within the lower end of global benchmarks for the power 
sector (Dietz, Gardiner, et al., 2021, p. 7; CAT, 2023b, p. 20; IEA, 
2023c, p. 199; Jaeger et al., 2023, p. 11), they do not meet the 
carbon intensity benchmarks set for the EU (CAT, 2023b, p. 19). 
Further, Enel commits to reduce absolute emissions across the 
value chain by 59% between 2019 and 2030, which would be 
in line with the 1.5°C-compatible trajectories for the sector at 
the global level. However, steeper reductions would be needed 
in the EU, where Enel generates the majority of its revenues.

Enel’s pledge to aim for deep decarbonisation by 2040 falls 
slightly short of the timelines required for electric utilities in 
advanced economies, which need to reach net zero by 2035 
(IEA, 2023c, p. 79). Enel commits to net-zero emissions by 
2040 (Enel, 2023b, p. 24), which translates to a reduction of 
98% below 2019 levels (see integrity assessment in Annex II). 
Although Enel’s 2040 intensity targets of 0 gCO2e/kWh for 
power generation and integrated power align with the global 
benchmarks, electric utilities in Europe should reach these 
intensity levels already in the 2030s (CAT, 2023b, p. 20). 
According to the IEA (IEA, 2023c, p. 79), the power sector in 
advanced economies should reach net zero by 2035. 

Enel commits to fully phasing out coal by 2027 and gas 
by 2040, meeting global and regional benchmarks. Enel’s 
commitment on coal extends to scope 1 (its own generation) as 
well as scope 3 upstream (purchased electricity) emissions. The 
company also plans to exit from gas-fired generation and retail 
gas sales by 2040. These commitments are in line with the IEA’s 
recommendation for advanced economies to phase out coal 
by 2030 and to limit the share of unabated gas in electricity 
generation to 5% by 2040 (IEA, 2023c, p. 92). 

Enel’s strategy emphasises on renewables and electrification. 
Enel is investing heavily in renewable energy, aiming to reach 
an 85% share of renewables in total installed capacities by 
2030 and achieve full reliance on renewables by 2040. This 
target surpasses the 1.5°C-compatible benchmarks for the 
sector, which recommends a 68% share of renewable energy in 
total installed capacity by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5°C 
(IEA, 2023c, p. 197). In parallel, Enel is focusing on electrifying 
sectors that currently rely on liquid fossil fuels. It is expanding 
its charging network to promote e-mobility and supporting the 
installation of heat pumps for domestic heating and induction 
cooktops in kitchens to facilitate the transition in the building 
sector. The company refrains from investing in potentially false 
solutions such as bioenergy and CC(U)S.

6.4 ENGIE

94Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



ENGIE
ENGIE is an international energy utility based in France. Most 
of the company’s emissions originate from energy production 
(electricity, heating, and cooling) (36%), sales of gas (35%), 
and upstream fuel chain (24%), mostly involving the resale 
of purchased electricity and the extraction and transport of 
raw materials. ENGIE aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 
2045, which is defined as a 90% GHG reduction compared to 
2017 levels. Gas will continue to play a role in the company’s 
operations even after reaching its net-zero target in 2045. 
ENGIE commits to a coal phase-out by 2027, although it is 
unclear whether this also covers electricity purchased for 
retail and shares in power plants it does not control. Overall, 
ENGIE’s climate strategy for 2030 and 2045 does not align 
with the 1.5° pathway for the power sector, which poses a risk 
of delaying decarbonisation in other sectors.

ENGIE presents various absolute and intensity reduction 
targets, but for some targets we could not identify the 
emission sources they cover. For instance, it is unclear what 
ENGIE means by its target to reduce “other GHG emissions, 
including scope 3 from procurement, capital goods and the 
upstream of purchased fuels and electricity” to 85 MtCO2e 
(ENGIE, 2023, p. 16). ENGIE does not specify what other 
emission sources are covered by this target. As a result, it is not 
possible to aggregate ENGIE’s various targets and understand 
the emission reductions across the value chain the company 
commits to. Based on our own analysis, we estimate that the 
various targets translate to a reduction of at least 24% by 2030, 
compared to 2019 levels (see integrity assessment in Annex II).

ENGIE’s short- and long-term climate targets are incompatible 
with the 1.5°C pathway for the sector. Aligning the energy 
sector with the 1.5°C-compatible pathway requires a steep 
and immediate reduction in carbon intensity and emissions 
over this decade. The net-zero emissions target by 2045 allows 
high volumes of residual emissions (14% of 2019 levels), with 
unspecified use of carbon sinks to neutralise them (ENGIE, 
2023, p. 68). ENGIE’s intensity targets for 2030, set at 110g 
CO2e per kWh for energy production (i.e. electricity, heating 
and cooling in scope 1) and energy consumption (scope 2), as 
well as 153g CO2e per kWh for energy sales produced (scopes 
1 and 3) and purchased (scope 3), are at the upper end of the 
carbon intensity range recommended in existing literature 

(Dietz, Gardiner, et al., 2021, p. 7; CAT, 2023b, p. 20; IEA, 
2023c, p. 199; Jaeger et al., 2023, p. 11). In terms of absolute 
targets, ENGIE’s target of reducing emissions by at least 24% 
between 2021 and 2030 (based on own calculations, see 
integrity assessment in Annex II) falls significantly short of the 
sector benchmark, which aims for a 44% reduction in the power 
sector globally (IEA, 2023, p. 62), and would postpone most 
of the necessary reductions beyond 2030. Additionally, the 
company has not set any interim targets between 2030 and its 
long-term target in 2045. 

There is some ambiguity surrounding ENGIE’s commitment to 
phase out coal, and the company does not plan to end gas use 
in its power plants fleet. The company has set a coal phase-out 
goal by 2027 (ENGIE, 2023, p. 68), but it is unclear whether 
this commitment only refers to ENGIE’s own power plants or 
also covers electricity purchased for resale and ENGIE’s share 
in power plants it does not control. In addition, ENGIE does not 
commit to significantly decommission its gas power plants by 
2030, which would be necessary to get on track for eventually 
phasing out gas. The company insists on the role of gas as a 
suitable flexibility option in the decarbonisation of the energy 
sector and supports the use of CCS to extend the life of gas 
power plants (ENGIE, 2023, p. 66). 

The pace of transitioning to alternatives appears too slow 
and relies on flawed assumptions. ENGIE is scaling up 
renewable energy capacity, with a focus on wind and solar in 
its strategy. The goal is to reach a 58% of renewables capacity 
in its energy mix by 2030. However, global benchmarks for 
the sector indicate that a 68% share of renewable energy in 
total installed capacity is necessary by 2030 to stay below 
the Paris Agreement’s warming limit of 1.5°C (IEA, 2023c, p. 
193). Regarding gas sales, ENGIE commits to achieving 100% 
decarbonised gas by 2045, but its strategy relies on potentially 
false solutions such as large amounts of biomethane and the 
use of green hydrogen in sectors where more energy-efficient 
alternatives exist. Overall, the company’s sustainability report 
indicates that it does not support the vision of large-scale 
electrification but sees the role of (decarbonised) gas as crucial 
in the transformation.

The assessment is based on the 2022 sustainability report; the information in 
the 2023 sustainability report does not lead to any changes in our evaluation.

Iberdrola 
Iberdrola is a multinational energy utility headquartered in 
Spain. Around half of the company's emissions originate from 
the upstream fuel chain, which includes the resale of purchased 
electricity, and the extraction, transport, and processing of fuels, 
while a quarter comes from the sales of fossil gas. Iberdrola has 
set both short- and medium-term goals to achieve net-zero 
emissions across its entire value chain by 2039. The company 
shut down its last coal-powered plants in 2020 and focuses on 
scaling up its renewable energy capacity generation, alongside 
phasing in green hydrogen to support decarbonisation in other 
sectors. These targets and measures align Iberdrola’s climate 
strategy mostly with a 1.5°-compatible trajectory. Despite 
these positive steps, a comprehensive plan to completely phase 
out fossil gas is still missing. 

While Iberdrola aims for deep decarbonisation by 2039, 
the company would need to bring its net-zero commitment 
forward by four years to be fully aligned with 1.5°C-compatible 
benchmarks for electric utilities in advanced economies 
(IEA, 2023c, p. 79). Iberdrola committed to net zero across all 
emission scopes before 2040 (Iberdrola, 2023f, p. 1). Alongside 
this net-zero target, the company pledged to reduce its own 
emissions by 90% below 2020 levels (Iberdrola, 2023g). While 
the IEA suggests that the global energy sector should reach 
net zero by 2045, advanced economies should reach this 
milestone already ten years earlier (IEA, 2023c, p. 79). Given 
that Iberdrola mainly operates in the European Union, United 
Kingdom and the United States, the company would have to 
bring its net-zero target forward to 2035 to meet this regional 
benchmark. Iberdrola’s interim target is to achieve carbon 
neutrality in scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 (Iberdrola, 
2023a), equivalent to a 68% reduction across the value chain 
compared to 2021. While this level of emissions reduction 
would be in line with the 1.5°C-compatible trajectories for 
the sector by 2030, using the term ‘carbon neutrality’ can be 
misleading to consumers and investors, as ‘carbon neutral’ 
suggests that Iberdrola will be close to fully decarbonised (see 
integrity assessment in Annex II).  

Although Iberdrola has completed its coal phase-out, the 
company has not published a comprehensive fossil gas phase-
out plan: the company neither commits to fully phasing out its 
fossil gas-fired power plants nor to ending its fossil gas sales. 
The company closed its last coal plant in 2020, well ahead 
of the 2030 deadlines for the phase-out of unabated coal in 
advanced economies (CAT, 2023b, p. 1; Iberdrola, 2023f, pp. 
87–88; IEA, 2023c, p. 62). However, Iberdrola has not yet 
publicly announced a plan for completely phasing out its gas-
fired power plants, which account for 15% of its own installed 
capacity and 24% of its own electricity generation (Iberdrola, 
2023b, p. 101, 2023d, p. 19). The only action taken towards 
addressing its fossil gas assets is the planned sale of its gas-fired 
power plants in Mexico instead of complete decommissioning 
(Iberdrola, 2023h). This misses the benchmark for aligning with 
a 1.5°C pathway, which requires advanced economies to phase 
out unabated gas by 2035 and the rest of the world by 2040 
(CAT, 2023b, p. 1). 

Iberdrola invests a significant portion of its capital expenditure 
to increase renewable energy capacity. In 2022, Iberdrola’s 
own installed renewable energy capacity accounted for 66% 
of its total installed capacity, while its own renewable energy 
generation accounted for 46% of its total generation (Iberdrola, 
2023g). Iberdrola aims to significantly expand its renewable 
capacity from 40 GW in 2022 to 95 GW by 2030, which will 
constitute approximately 93% of its total installed capacity 
(Iberdrola, 2020, p. 6). This target shows that the company 
is on track to meet global 1.5 °C-compatible benchmarks, 
which recommend a 68%-77% share of renewable energy in 
total installed capacity and a 59%-89% share of renewable 
energy in generation mix by 2030 (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; 
CAT, 2023b, p. 16; IEA, 2023c, p. 197; IRENA, 2023c, pp. 
22, 75). Also in 2022, Iberdrola allocated 86% of its capital 
expenditure to activities that support the implementation of 
critical transitional and enabling measures identified for electric 
utilities (see Section 7.2: Electric Utilities – Sectoral Transition 
Framework). Around half of this investment was directed toward 
solar PV, wind, and hydropower projects, with the remaining 
portion allocated to the grid (Iberdrola, 2023d, pp. 245–246). 
Iberdrola is also adopting green hydrogen and electrification 
technologies, including extensive electric vehicle charging 
infrastructure (Iberdrola, 2023f, p. 98).

Iberdrola's strategy for claiming the neutralisation of its 
residual emissions relies on ecosystem conservation and 
restoration, which is not a credible equivalent to reducing 
emissions. The company plans to achieve net zero by 
neutralising the remaining 10% of its 2020 emissions through 
land sequestration carbon dioxide removal (Iberdrola, 2023f, p. 
111). Central to this plan is the Carbon2Nature venture owned 
by Iberdrola, which aims to plant 20 million trees by 2030, 
predominantly in Latin American countries. The company 
anticipates that this initiative will have a carbon capture and 
storage capacity of over 6 million tonne CO2 over the next 30 
years (Iberdrola, 2022, 2023e). Due to several environmental 
constraints and the non-permanent nature of these removals, 
this does not represent a credible equivalent to emissions 
reduction (see Section 3.5 in this report and Section 4.1.3 in the 
Methodology document).

6.6 KEPCO

98Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



KEPCO
Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) is a major state-
owned electric utility headquartered in South Korea. KEPCO 
accounts for almost 60% of the country’s generation capacity 
and engages in overseas projects in 16 other countries, mainly 
in the Asia Pacific region. The majority of the company’s 
emissions originate from the upstream fuel chain (54%), 
which includes the purchase of electricity and the extraction 
and transport of coal and fossil gas, followed by electricity 
generation of its group companies (37%). More than 60% of 
KEPCO’s generation capacity is comprised of coal and fossil 
gas. KEPCO committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, but 1.5°C 
compatibility for the power sector in advanced economies 
requires net-zero emissions already by 2035. KEPCO’s carbon 
neutrality target may be further undermined by inconsistent 
reporting, inadequate renewable targets, a delayed coal 
phaseout, and the risk of gas lock-in.

KEPCO’s emission disclosure lacks consistency and 
transparency. The company's emissions data appears unclear 
and inconsistent, as KEPCO uses non-standardised units 
and categories across various emission scopes. In its 2022 
sustainability report, KEPCO even presents differing figures for 
scope 1 and 2 emissions within the same document, both in the 
main section and the appendix (KEPCO, 2022, pp. 78-79,180-
181). This inconsistency extends to the presentation of key 
milestones in KEPCO’s strategic roadmap, making it difficult to 
assess essential metrics like carbon intensity, phaseout dates 
for fossil fuels, and generation and capacity mix. For instance, 
its overseas coal phaseout roadmap features varying years, 
showing one set of figures for 2022 and 2030, a different set 
of figures for 2030 and 2035, and another set for 2030 and 
2050 (KEPCO, 2022, p. 59). Such inconsistency complicates 
the understanding of KEPCO’s long-term plans and comparing 
them against established benchmarks.

KEPCO's interim and long-term goals for carbon neutrality not 
only fall short of aligning with a 1.5°C-compatible pathway, but 
the plans to achieve them remain vague, too. KEPCO pledged to 
achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, mirroring the South Korean 
government’s goal. However, it does not meet the urgent timelines 
required for electric utilities in advanced economies, which should 
aim for net zero by 2035 (IEA, 2023c, p. 79). KEPCO’s carbon 
neutrality target and its short-term target for 2030 exclude scope 

3 emissions, which is equivalent to over half of its total emissions 
in 2021 (KEPCO, 2022, p. 69,181). Also, details are missing from 
the plans to achieve those targets. The company does not specify 
what share of the carbon neutrality target will be achieved through 
emissions reductions within the value chain and what share will 
come from neutralisation. Overall, KEPCO’s carbon neutrality 
roadmap fails to articulate how the implementation of each 
mitigation measure will translate to tangible emission reductions.

KEPCO’s coal and fossil gas phaseout appears too slow, posing 
the risk of stranded assets. KEPCO commits to phasing out coal 
and fossil gas by 2050 (Climate Action 100+, 2022; KEPCO, 
2022, p. 59,68), 15-20 years later than the required timeline 
for advanced economies (CAT, 2023b, p. 1; IEA, 2023c, p. 62). 
KEPCO is still actively involved in constructing new coal-fired 
plants in Vietnam (2.4 GW) and Indonesia (2 GW) (KEPCO, 2022, 
p. 58). By 2030, KEPCO plans to expedite coal exit from overseas 
projects by selling its existing coal-fired power plants (KEPCO, 
2022, p. 59), instead of decommissioning them. Another concern 
arises from KEPCO’s conviction of gas as a ‘transition fuel’ in 
its coal phaseout plan, as evidenced by the company’s decision 
to increase the capacity of combined cycle gas power plants, 
both domestically and internationally, to replace its coal fleets 
(KEPCO, 2022, p. 54,56, 2023, p. 32). For example, the recently 
commissioned gas-fired power plant in Malaysia is expected 
to operate for another 21 years, thereby increasing the risk of 
future stranded assets (KEPCO, 2022, p. 54,60).

KEPCO's progress in incorporating in renewables into its 
energy mix is critically inadequate to be aligned with 1.5°C 
trajectories for the sector. In 2022, only 3.3% of its electricity 
production came from renewables, remaining stagnant from 
2021 (KEPCO, 2022, p. 11, 2023, p. 11). The company's target 
of increasing this share to 21.5% by 2030 (KEPCO, 2022, p. 70) 
significantly lags behind the 1.5°C-compatible global benchmark 
of 59-89% renewables share by 2030 (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29; 
CAT, 2023b, p. 16; IEA, 2023c, p. 197; IRENA, 2023c, pp. 22, 
75). KEPCO's strategy also includes co-firing 20% of ammonia 
in coal-fired power generation and 50% of hydrogen in gas-fired 
power generation by 2036, with a goal of reaching 100% by 
2050 (KEPCO, 2023, p. 13). There is a risk that such plans would 
extend the use of existing fossil fuel infrastructure, rather than 
a genuine pivot towards more sustainable alternatives, such as 
renewables-based electrification.

KEPCO's emissions reductions measure involves 
commercialising carbon capture, utilisation, and storage 
(CCUS) technologies, which we consider a false solution for 
the power sector. If unable to sell its overseas coal assets 
by 2030, KEPCO plans to resort to CCUS as a backup plan 
(KEPCO, 2022, p. 59,69,76). This reliance on CCUS in electricity 
generation faces severe risks given these technologies' 
unproven efficacy and potential environmental impacts, not 
to mention that it comes at a high cost compared to switching 
to renewables (Grant et al., 2021). KEPCO's earnings have 
been on a downward trend, with a substantial operating loss 
in the fiscal year 2022 due to high and volatile energy costs, as 
well as capped electricity rates in South Korea (Ng and Ilango, 
2022; Ng, 2023). This financial trend highlights the potential 
risk of relying on CCUS, which practically means continuing its 
dependence on fossil fuels.

Table 19 provides a summary overview of our transparency and integrity ratings for Adidas, 
Fast Retailing, H&M Group, Inditex and Nike. 

Table 19: Overview of integrity ratings for fashion companies

•	 Emissions in the fashion sector stem mostly from sourcing raw materials and from 
material production. Many of these emissions can be addressed by sourcing renewable 
electricity and electrifying processes such as textile preparation and colouration. For 
fashion retailers, most emissions are located in the supply chain.

•	 We see an improvement in fashion retailers’ emissions disclosure and target setting 
practices, both for medium- and long-term targets. 

•	 The extent to which companies’ seemingly ambitious targets are credible will largely 
depend on the integrity of their strategies for renewable energy in the supply chain. 
Despite limited details on supply chain measures, we see signs of high reliance on 
bioenergy and renewable energy certificates to claim emission reductions. This could 
significantly undermine the real ambition of these companies’ targets.

•	 It remains unclear to what extent companies’ measures will contribute to and be 
sufficient for achieving their targets. All the companies assessed mostly demonstrate 
awareness of what the key decarbonisation measures for the sector are. However, they 
present their planned measures in quite ambiguous terms. 

•	 We have not seen any clear references to more fundamental business-model transitions, 
although most companies reflect on the need for the fashion sector to become more 
sustainable in terms of resource use and GHG emissions. This is especially important as 
a shift towards a sustainable fashion industry will necessarily mean producing and selling 
fewer products, which can be at odds with the fast fashion business-model.

7.2 Sectoral transition framework
The global fashion industry currently emits 0.9-1.2 GtCO2e 
per year, or around 5% of global emissions (Nature Climate 
Change Editorial, 2018; Sadowski, 2023). The sector needs to 
significantly reduce emissions to align with the Paris agreement 
1.5°C temperature goal. According to recent literature, apparel 
producers will need to reduce its scope 1 emissions by 39-44%, 
scope 2 by 49-67% and scope 3 by 37% below 2019 levels 
by 2030 (Dietz, Hastreiter, et al., 2021; Teske, 2022, p. 327). 
Additionally, the 2023 One Earth Climate Model requires the 
leather and textile manufacturing industry to reduce the carbon 
intensity of its electricity and heat supply to 57 gCO2/kWh 
by 2030 (Teske et al., 2023 data provided in Dataset 2). For 
fashion companies such as those covered in our analysis, these 
benchmarks apply to their supply chain. Finally, SBTi requires 
fashion companies to reduce their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
by 4.2% a year to be 1.5°C compatible (SBTi, 2018, p. 20). 

Emissions from major fashion brands are located mostly in 
the supply chain. For apparel companies, scope 1 emissions 
(with science-based targets) only account for 1% of their total 
emissions, while scope 3 represents around 96% (Ley et al., 
2021). The supply chain of fashion companies can be broken 
down into four distinct categories (Sadowski et al., 2021; 
Sadowski, 2023): 

•	 Tier 4 - raw material extraction: this includes the 
cultivation of crops used for fabric such as cotton, as 
well as the extraction of materials such as nylon and 
polyester from fossil fuels. It is responsible for around 
23% of scope 3 emissions.

•	 Tier 3 – raw material processing: this includes 
processing raw materials into yarn and other 
intermediate products. It is responsible for around 15% 
of scope 3 emissions.

•	 Tier 2 – material production: this includes textile 
formation (knitting or weaving yarn into fabric), 
preparation, such as scouring, coloration and additional 
coloration and finishing, such as heat setting. It is 
responsible for around 53% of scope 3 emissions.

•	 Tier 1 – finished product assembly: this includes the 
final assembly of products, including cutting and sewing 
of fabric into garments. It is responsible for around 8% of 
scope 3 emissions.

By far, the largest source of emissions in this industry is 
the use of fossil fuels to produce electricity and heat for 
manufacturing. Especially significant is the use of coal to 
generate heat for tier 2 processes. Acknowledging this, many 
companies set out plans to replace coal for biomass in their 
tier 2 suppliers, claiming that biomass burning would be a zero 
or close to zero emissions fuel source. This position has been 
seriously challenged by recent research, which has identified 
a series of direct and indirect impacts of the widespread use 
of biomass, such as incentives for deforestation, which casts 
serious doubt over the potential benefits of switching to 
biomass (Searchinger and Heimlich, 2015; Sterman et al., 2018; 
Flynn and Ball, 2023; Trend Asia, 2023). The industry should 
instead push towards full electrification of the manufacturing 
process, as well as the large-scale development of renewable 
electricity to meaningfully and sustainably reduce their scope 
3 emissions. 

To sustainably meet demand in future years, these companies 
will likely need to go beyond increasing energy efficiency 
and the use of renewables, to also shift their business model 
towards more quality and less quantity. This shift needs to 
involve a focus on quality and durability of products, policies 
to resale, repair and recycle them, and fundamentally, a shift 
towards less production. According to some estimates, around 
73% of the growth in apparel manufacturing between 1980 and 
2014 can be attributed to the rise of cheap, fossil fuel-based 
fabrics such as nylon and polyester. These emissions cannot 
be eliminated, and there are no readily available, carbon-free 
alternatives (Stand.earth, 2023). Additionally, many sources of 
the industry’s emissions that are technically possible to abate, 
are in practice challenging to reduce at the needed pace, and 
in a sustainable and fair way to workers in manufacturing 
hubs. Growing demand, and intense competition drive prices 
down and make it all the more challenging. The fundamental 
problem with the fast fashion business model is already well 
understood and acknowledged by major fashion companies, 
but there is still a long way to go to achieve meaningful change 
(Drew and Yehounme, 2017; Stand.earth, 2023).

101Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Key actions and measures for the fashion sector 
Measures to reduce emissions from raw materials (upstream scope 3) 

These emissions are currently some of the hardest to eliminate from the fashion industry value chain, as there are no GHG-free alternatives. However, these emissions can be reduced by 
increasing the use of current lower-GHG alternatives, and the development and adoption of innovative alternatives.

Commit to lower-GHG material sourcing targets, 
including recycled fibres and preferred cotton while 
specifying the GHG-performance of both traditional 
and alternative products sourced
  Critical transitional measure 
Emissions from raw materials vary significantly across 
materials. Commonly used synthetic materials such as 
polyester and nylon are made from crude oil and have a 
substantially higher GHG footprint than natural materials. 
For example, a 2018 study estimated that the emissions 
associated with producing a polyester t-shirt are 5.5 kg CO2e, 
compared to 2.1 kg CO2e  for the production of a cotton 
t-shirt (Nature Climate Change Editorial, 2018). However, 
although its GHG footprint is lower, the use of cotton as a 
raw material also brings its complications, for example land 
and water use, pesticide pollution, and competition with 
food crops for arable land.
 
Current alternatives include mechanically-recycled polyester, 
mechanically-recycled nylon, organic/preferred cotton, 
mechanically-recycled cotton and viscose sourced from 
sustainable fibres (Ley et al., 2021; Sadowski et al., 2021; 
Sadowski, 2023). However, challenges associated with these 
processes such as energy requirements and costs also need 
to be addressed by companies. One especially important 
aspect is that recycled materials should stem from products 
of the industry (i.e. apparel and related products), which for 
polyester and nylon might be significantly more challenging 
to process than alternatives such as plastic bottles.

Invest in innovative alternatives such as 
biosynthetic fibres and cotton alternatives to 
accelerate their development    Enabling measure 
Innovative alternatives include biosynthetic fibres, including 
Bio-PET (Polyethylene terephthalate), Bio-PA (Polyamide 
e.g. nylon) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). They also 
include the use of other natural fibres alternative to cotton, 
such as hemp, which can be “cottonised” to resemble the 
properties of cotton (Ley et al., 2021; Sadowski et al., 2021; 
Sadowski, 2023). 

Support suppliers to implement sustainable 
farming practices to increase the GHG-efficiency 
of production    Enabling measure
Beyond committing to source higher shares of sustainable 
materials, companies can also help their tier 4 suppliers, 
which can sometimes be smaller businesses, to implement 
best farming practices to reduce the GHG-intensity of 
their products. 

102Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Measures to reduce emissions from manufacturing (upstream scope 3) 

Manufacturing emissions in the fashion industry stem mostly from power and heat. There are three main ways to reduce them: RE procurement and generation, increasing energy 
efficiency, and electrification 

Commit to 100% renewable electricity in the supply chain    
  Critical transitional measure 
Renewable electricity procurement is key to decarbonise 
the fashion industry manufacturing process. Emissions from 
tier 1 and 3 of the manufacturing process stem mostly from 
electricity, and could be greatly reduced by switching to 100% 
renewables using high-quality procurement constructs (Ley 
et al., 2021; Sadowski et al., 2021; Sadowski, 2023).

Invest in energy efficiency measures, particularly 
to reduce their need for thermal energy in tier 2 
processes (for example through dry processing)    
  Critical transitional measure 
Efficiency measures are low-hanging fruit to reduce emissions 
because they have high returns on investment through 
energy savings. However, they also carry high upfront costs. 
Energy efficiency measures with high impact mostly focus 
on conserving and recovering heat.

One key measure to reduce emissions from apparel 
manufacturing is switching to dry processing (tier 2), which 
can decrease energy use by around 80%.  Tier 2 process 
emissions, which represent over half of the industry’s 
emissions, come from the use of coal to generate heat for 
textile processing, which is done in large tanks of hot water. 

Commit to phase-out coal from value chain, 
replacing it with renewable heat (such as CSP), or 
through the electrification of key tier 2 processes 
(such as dyeing and finishing)
  Critical transitional measure 
Electrification of heat generation processes will also be 
necessary to ensure that the manufacturing process can 
achieve zero GHG emissions. Currently some major fashion 
brands are starting to make a move away from coal towards 
biomass for heat production, but this does not necessarily 
reduce emissions compared to fossil fuels, and it can have 
other adverse effects.  

Measures to shift towards a more sustainable business model

Set reduced overproduction targets and policies to stop discarding new products
  Critical transitional measure
A low-hanging fruit to reduce the environmental impact of the industry is to reduce the number 
of products being discarded throughout the value chain, but especially at the retail level. For 
example, according to some estimates, reducing overproduction (that is the waste generated 
due to unsold stock) by 10% through more efficient supply chains and more accurate demand 
forecast tools could reduce industry-wide emissions by 9% by 2030 (Berg et al., 2020).

Set resale, repair and recycle programs with meaningful and clear targets    
  Enabling measure
Most large fashion brands now have at least some type of resale, repair or recycle 
programmes. These can be useful to support a shift to more sustainable business model 
without overproduction, but without scale, they will likely not have a meaningful impact. 
Companies need to clearly communicate the scope and scale of their programmes, and 
transparently show how they can help reduce consumption by extending product life. It 
is especially important for companies to also address the limitations of current recycling 
practices, especially for used apparel and related products.

N/A



 Adidas
Adidas AG, headquartered in Germany, is one of the world’s 
largest sportswear brands. About 90% of its emissions 
stem from the production and processing of raw materials 
and assembly of clothes and shoes (all scope 3, category 
1). Adidas implements several promising measures for the 
decarbonisation of its supply chain, including to phase out coal 
and increase the use of renewables. However, the company’s 
2030 target is insufficient to be aligned with 1.5°C-compatible 
benchmarks for the sector, and its climate neutrality target 
for 2050 is not yet substantiated with a clear commitment to 
reduce emissions across the value chain.

translates to approximately a reduction of 32-44% of the 
company’s full value chain emissions, compared to average 
emissions in the time frame between 2017 and 2023. This 
would indicate a significant reduction, and the upper end of 
that estimate would be aligned with sector-specific emission 
reduction benchmarks for the textile and leather industry, 
which indicate that emissions should decrease by at least 41% 
between 2019 and 2030 to be aligned with a 1.5°C-compatible 
trajectory (Teske, 2022, pp. 322, 327). However, the feasibility 
of achieving the target is called into question by the fact that 
until 2023, Adidas had not achieved any absolute decrease in 
emissions below 2017 levels.

Adidas’s ‘Decarbonization Manifesto’ combines a range of 
promising support measures, incentives, and requirements for 
its suppliers to move away from using coal in the production 
process. Adidas requires its tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers to phase 
phase-out coal boilers by 2025 but allows them to switch 
to natural gas or biomass (Adidas, 2024, p. 87). Neither is a 
credible decarbonisation option: switching to natural gas-
fired boilers may lead to locking in fossil fuels, while biomass 
production and combustion leads to GHG emissions and a 
range of other sustainability problems, including biodiversity 
loss (see section 3.3).

Adidas’s plan to provide support for suppliers to access PPAs 
to procure renewable electricity could represent another 
promising signal (Adidas, 2024, p. 87).  However, we could 
not identify further details on what this support entails and 
what outcomes it has achieved. At the same time, Adidas 
also encourages suppliers to procure standalone RECs, which 
are far less likely to result in real emission reductions than 
PPAs. High-quality procurement constructs can be especially 
difficult to access in some countries, so it is encouraging to see 
evidence of advocacy efforts with national governments and 
grid operators in Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam (Adidas, 
2023b, p. 84). Adidas also reports that it will consider suppliers’ 
performance on renewable electricity procurement in their 
supplier assessment process.

Adidas’s plans for “sustainable articles” are unsubstantiated 
and may not result in significant GHG emission reductions. 
The company set out the ambition that 90% of its articles will be 
sustainable by 2025 (Adidas, 2024, p. 90), using an ambiguous 

definition. Adidas considers articles to be sustainable “when 
they show environmental benefits versus conventional 
articles due to the materials used, meaning that they are – to 
a significant degree – made with environmentally preferred 
materials.” While Adidas provides examples of such materials, 
these were insufficient to appreciate their mitigation potential. 
There are also concerns about the effectiveness of some of 
the standards that Adidas uses to select “environmentally 
preferred materials”. For instance, while the company claims 
that 99% of its leather volume is audited in accordance with 
the Leather Working Group protocol (Adidas, 2024, p. 91), the 
production of its sneakers is linked to animal husbandry in and 
deforestation of the Amazon (Stand.earth, 2021; Heugten, 
2024).  Adidas does not follow the HLEG’s key recommendation 
to a deforestation-free supply chain by 2025 (UN HLEG, 2022, 
p. 26). The committed to a “deforestation and conversion free”
leather supply chain by 2030 and started to map its supply chain 
beyond tier 3 suppliers, but does not yet present a concrete set
of measures to end deforestation linked to leather production
(Adidas, 2024, pp. 92, 94). Adidas plans to set “deforestation
and conversion free” targets for natural rubber and timber-
derived materials in the future.

The assessment is based on the 2022 sustainability report; the information in the 2023 
sustainability report published in March 2024 does not lead to any changes in our evaluation.

Adidas’s 2025 climate neutrality target for its own 
operations has the potential to mislead consumers, while the 
2050 climate neutrality target for all emissions is not 
substantiated with an emission reduction target. Adidas aims 
to achieve climate neutrality in its own operations by 2025. 
Within this target, the company committed to reduce scope 1 
and 2 emissions by 90% below a 2017 baseline. Since 
operational emissions account for just 1% of Adidas’s 
emissions along the value chain, this climate neutrality target 
is highly likely to be misleading to consumers. Adidas also 
committed to climate neutrality across the value chain by 
2050 but has not provided further information on this target 
(Adidas, 2024). It remains unclear what share of its value 
chain emissions Adidas plans to reduce towards achieving its 
climate neutrality claim and what share will be offset with 
reductions or removals outside the company’s value chain.

Adidas’s 2030 target may be partially aligned with 1.5°C-
compatible benchmarks, but Adidas has not yet made 
progress towards the target since 2017, and its significance 
is not entirely clear due to highly variable emissions 
reported in recent years. The significance of Adidas’s target 
to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 is not immediately clear, 
since Adidas does not publish its emissions for the target base 
year in 2017 in its public documentation. The 2017 baseline 
emissions are only available in Adidas’s non-public CDP 
response (Adidas, 2023a, pp. 69–74). The meaning of the 
target is further complicated by the fact that Adidas reports 
major fluctuations in emissions in the period between 2017 
and 2023: 2019 emissions are nearly double the reported 
emissions in 2017, while values for 2021 to 2023 are closer 
to the 2017 values. We estimate that the target

106Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024

N/A



Fast Retailing
Fast Retailing Co., Ltd. (Fast Retailing) is a Japanese fashion 
retail multinational company that owns the Uniqlo brand, 
among others. Most of its emissions stem from materials 
sourcing and manufacturing in the supply chain (~95%). To 
tackle these emissions, the company facilitates suppliers to 
develop emission reduction plans, but it discloses few details 
on the goals and ambitions of these plans. The company’s 2030 
emission reduction targets fall far short of what is needed to 
limit global warming to 1.5°C.

Key developments over the past year: We could identify only 
minor changes to Fast Retailing’s sustainability strategy from 
our previous analysis of the case study in the 2022 Corporate 
Climate Responsibility Monitor (Day et al., 2022). Accordingly, 
only minor modifications were made to this case study. 

Fast Retailing’s 2030 targets collectively amount to a reduction 
of 19% of the company’s emissions footprint compared to 
2019, which is not aligned with global efforts to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C. Fast Retailing has two targets to be achieved 
by 2030, these are validated to be 1.5°C-compatible by the 
SBTi. The first one is 20% absolute reduction of supply-chain 
emissions, specifically from raw materials, fabric, and garment 
production for the Uniqlo and GU brands, which represent 
~95% of the company’s revenue (Fast Retailing, 2023b, p. 
17). The second one is 90% absolute reduction of operational 
emissions (scopes 1 and 2, under direct company control) (Fast 
Retailing, 2021, p. 29). These two targets cover 74% of the 
company’s emissions footprint and exclude emission sources 
like the end-of-life treatment of sold products. They equate to 
an emissions reduction commitment of just 19% across the full 
value chain, compared to 2019 levels, falling short of the IPCC’s 
estimate of minimum 43% global GHG emission reductions by 
2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C (IPCC, 2022). Furthermore, 
a sectoral 1.5°C-aligned benchmark indicates that fashion 
retailers should reduce upstream scope 3 emissions by a 
minimum of 41% between 2019 and 2030 (Teske, 2022), but 
Fast Retailing only commits to 16% upstream scope 3 emission 
reductions by that year. 

Fast Retailing has expressed the aim to reach net-zero 
emissions by 2050, but it has not disclosed a concrete plan for 
emission reductions between 2030 and 2050. Fast Retailing’s 

climate strategy focuses on 2030 emission reduction targets. 
Although it expresses the intention to ‘strengthen our efforts 
to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050’ (Fast Retailing, 
2023b, p. 17), it does not clarify what these efforts would entail 
in the future. The company does not disclose whether it will 
reach the net-zero target through further emission reductions 
or through emissions offsetting in the 2030–2050 period. 

Fast Retailing’s emission reduction measures focus on 
emission reduction plans for supplying factories, but 
details on how the company engages with suppliers—the 
company’s main source of emissions—remain limited. To 
address emissions from corporate sites, Fast Retailing aims to 
improve energy efficiency by installing LED lighting, automatic 
temperature control, and more efficient air conditioning (Fast 
Retailing, 2023b, p. 56, 2023a). However, these measures only 
target 5% of the company’s emissions footprint (scope 2) (Fast 
Retailing, 2023a). Fast Retailing’s most significant source of 
emissions (76% of its emissions footprint) is the manufacturing 
of garments in third-party factories, including raw material 
production, fabric production, and sewing. To address 
these emissions, the company reports to be recycling more 
materials and piloting clothing repair stations (Uniqlo, 2022; 
Fast Retailing, 2023a). While repair stations could potentially 
extend products’ lifetimes, they would have a significant 
impact in emission reductions only if they would lead to a shift 
in consumer behaviour and a reduction in the volume of new 
garments purchased and produced. We did not identify any 
clear indication that Fast Retailing is preparing to shift away 
from a fast fashion business model. 

Fast Retailing also claims to cooperate with suppliers by 
providing them with supplier-tailored emission reduction 
plans (Fast Retailing, 2023b, p. 56, 2023a). These include 
energy-saving and renewable-energy measures, like eliminating 
coal energy from manufacturing processes, and Fast Retailing 
pledges support for their implementation (Fast Retailing, 2023b, 
p. 56). However, the company does not provide specifics on the 
coverage and depth of the emission reduction plans, what its
pledged support entails, or how it aims to enforce them. While
this level of supplier interaction may represent good practice,
the lack of details does not facilitate a complete understanding
of whether Fast Retailing’s strategy will be sufficiently effective
at reducing supply-chain emissions.

Fast Retailing aims to use 100% renewable electricity by 2030, 
but it does not commit to procurement options that would 
likely result in additional renewable electricity capacity. In 
2022, Fast Retailing claims to have sourced 42% of its electricity 
consumption from renewable sources (Fast Retailing, 2023a, p. 
3). In 2021, the company recently installed solar PV capacity 
at 13 stores in Japan, and in 2022 it expanded the initiative 
to its North America and Southeast Asia stores, specifying 
that electricity will be procured through PPAs. However, the 
company’s electricity procurement in 2022 came almost 
exclusively from standalone RECs. To ensure that its 2030 
renewable electricity target results in truly additional renewable 
electricity capacity and the abatement of the company’s 
energy-related emissions, Fast Retailing should move towards 
high-quality constructs and 24/7 matching.

The assessment is based on the 2022 sustainability report; the information in the 2023 
sustainability report published in March 2024 does not lead to any changes in our evaluation.

108Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024

N/A



H&M Group 
H&M Group is a Sweden-based fast fashion retailer that 
comprises of eight brands, including H&M, COS and 
Monki. The majority of H&M Group’s emissions stem 
from fabric production, garment manufacturing and raw 
materials (~92%). Although H&M Group has ambitious 
emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2040, those may 
be undermined by the lack of a clear plan for implementing 
measures to achieve those targets.

Key developments over the past year: We could identify only 
minor changes to H&M Group’s sustainability strategy since 
our previous analysis of the case study in the 2022 Corporate 
Climate Responsibility Monitor (Day et al., 2022). Accordingly, 
only minor modifications were made to this case study. 

H&M Group plans to reduce emissions across its value chain 
by 56% by 2030 and by 90% by 2040 below 2019. These 
may be ambitious targets that signal the need for immediate 
climate action, as long as they are not undermined by reliance 
on standalone RECs and biomass to claim decarbonisation of 
the supply chain. Their 2040 net-zero target is accompanied 
by the commitment to reduce emissions across the value 
chain by 90%. H&M group plans to offset the remaining 10% 
of emissions with “permanent” carbon dioxide removals and 
has recently signed an agreement for direct air capture (DAC) 
(H&M Group, 2023d, p. 31). This ambition level goes beyond 
the global benchmark for a 1.5-compatible emission reduction 
trajectory. However, the true ambition level of H&M Group’s 
targets depends on the measures used to achieve them. Based 
on their latest CDP disclosure, we see signals that the company 
could be planning to rely heavily on standalone RECs and 
biomass to claim the decarbonisation of its supply chain, which 
could severely compromise these targets (H&M Group, 2023b).

H&M Group committed to a target of 100% renewable 
electricity in the supply chain by 2030, but the significance 
of the target may be undermined by the lack of commitment 
to electrify key manufacturing processes. The company states 
that by 2030, the electricity sourced in the supply chain will 
be 100% renewable (H&M Group, 2023d, p. 26). Given that 
most of the company’s suppliers are based in Southeast Asia, 
where policies are often not conducive to renewable energy 
procurement, this target may be ambitious. However, much 

of the energy consumption in the clothing manufacturing 
process typically derives from other energy carriers, and we 
identify no commitment to shift to non-combustible sources 
of renewable power (e.g. wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal), 
but only a mention of a “push to phase out coal and electrify 
steam” (H&M Group, 2023a). As such, the supply chain 
renewable electricity target may be somewhat misleading due 
to its limited significance. We could also not clearly identify 
how H&M Group plans to achieve this target. The company 
lists several initiatives, including an Energy Expert Team that 
provides suppliers with data, information and training on 
renewable energy and energy efficiency, and the initiation of 
a Sustainable Supplier Facility that allows brands and suppliers 
to co-invest in in decarbonisation technologies (H&M Group, 
2023c). These plans may represent good practice examples for 
supplier engagement, but further details would be necessary to 
understand their real impact.

H&M Group covers most key emission reduction measures; 
however, more detailed information is needed to understand 
their likely reduction impact. Decarbonising the fashion sector 
requires a diverse set of reduction measures, including reducing 
overproduction, phasing out coal, switching to renewable 
energy, maximising material and energy efficiency, and ramping 
up the development of innovative materials (Berg et al., 2020; 
Ley et al., 2021; Sadowski et al., 2021). While H&M Group 
refers to most of these measures in its public communications, 
it stops short of disclosing to what extent these will reduce 
emissions across the value chain (H&M Group, 2023d). For 
example, measures to support farmers (tier 4) as well as tier 
1 and 2 suppliers cover necessary areas but lack detail about 
the GHG impact of their implementation. Measures and 
targets related to sourcing more sustainable and recycled 
materials (so-called “preferred materials”) provide enough 
detail to understand the current situation and progress towards 
targets but lack information regarding the GHG performance 
of “preferred materials” and recycled materials, to understand 
the full impact of the switch. H&M Group refers to external 
sustainability standards to define what counts under their 
“preferred materials”, such as the Materials Sustainability Index, 
but fail to disclose GHG performance data of their current 
and future materials. The company also highlights various 
innovative materials they are investing in but does not outline 
to what scale these could be used in the next decade and what 

their emission reduction potential is. Finally, while the company 
claims to be in the process of shifting towards a circular fashion 
model, it does not refer to the impact of such a shift on its 
production volumes, resource intensity and GHG footprint.

H&M Group commits to 100% renewable energy in its own 
operations, but this target will only result in real emission 
reduction if the renewable energy is sourced from high-
quality constructs.  H&M Group claims that in 2022, 92% 
of its electricity consumption came from renewable sources 
(H&M Group, 2023d, p. 31). This is mostly done through the 
procurement of standalone RECs, which in some cases are 
purchased in one country and used in another. For example, 
H&M Group uses Norwegian RECs to claim their electricity 
consumption in Bulgaria and Croatia came from renewable 
sources. Standalone RECs do not generally contribute to the 
installation of additional renewable energy capacity and are not 
a suitable approach for companies to reduce their 
electricity-related emissions. In 2024, H&M group 
complemented their existing renewables target, by adding that 
by 2030, at least half of the renewable energy procured for 
their own operations should come from PPAs with new 
renewable electricity generation (H&M Group 2024, p21). 
H&M Group could further improve its future renewable 
sourcing strategy by making clearer commitments to using 
only high-quality constructs and moving to a 24/7 matching 
approach.

N/A



Inditex
Industria de Diseno Textil S.A. (Inditex) is a Spanish-based 
multinational fashion retailer, better known for its flagship 
brand Zara. It is the biggest fast fashion group in the world by 
revenue, with USD 34.2 billion in 2022. Most of its emissions 
stem from its supply chain, especially those related to the 
sourcing and processing of raw materials. Inditex’s pledge for 
net-zero emissions by 2040 implies an ambitious 89% emission 
reduction below 2019 levels, which is aligned with 1.5°C 
benchmarks for the sector. However, the sufficiency of Inditex’s 
emission reduction measures to meet the company’s ambitious 
targets remains unclear. 

Inditex’s net zero pledge is now substantiated by a deep emission 
reduction target across the value chain. Since our last analysis 
in February 2023, Inditex has updated its climate commitments 
(Inditex, 2023b, p. 7) which now include a commitment to achieve 
a 90% emission reduction across all scopes by 2040 below 2018 
levels. We have estimated that this target implies an 89% reduction 
below 2019 levels by 2040, which is aligned with sector-specific 
benchmarks to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Inditex’s new target 
represents a significant improvement compared to our previous 
assessment, but its significance for reducing global emissions will 
hinge on how emissions from energy in the value chain are reduced. 

The company’s interim 2030 targets amount to a 46% emissions 
reduction below 2019 levels, which is also likely aligned with global 
efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Inditex has also updated 
its 2030 emission reduction targets in the past year. It specified that 
its scope 1 and 2 target of a 90% reduction below 2018 levels only 
covers market-based scope 2 emissions, excluding location-based 
scope 2 emissions (for more information on why it is important that 
companies report scope 2 emissions under both accounting methods, 
please see Methodology Section 1.1). Inditex has also committed 
to reducing its scope 3 emissions (excluding capital goods and 
franchises) by 50% below 2018 levels (Inditex, 2023b, p. 7). This 
target has been substantially improved since our last assessment in 
2022 (up from 20%), and now brings Inditex’s overall 2030 climate 
commitments in line with existing 1.5°C-compatible benchmarks. 

Inditex’s current approach to procuring renewable electricity has 
significant limitations that undermine its 100% renewables claim. 
With the information available, we understand that over 99% of 
Inditex’s operational electricity consumption in 2022 was matched 

by standalone RECs of unspecified vintages. Self-generation 
projects in specific locations accounted for a very minor share of 
supply. Although Inditex specifies that it purchases RECs from the 
same grid on which demand is placed, the purchase of standalone 
RECs offers no real prospects for supporting additional renewable 
energy capacity and grid decarbonisation in many regions, including 
Europe, which is the major region of Inditex’s operations (Mulder and 
Zomer, 2016; Brander et al., 2018; Bjørn et al., 2022). Recognising 
the need to improve its renewable electricity procurement, Inditex 
aims to source 60% of its electricity demand from own generation 
and PPAs and VPPAs by 2030 (Inditex, 2024b, p. 10). While this is 
likely a step forward from their current practice of 99% standalone 
REC procurement, the integrity of their new target will depend on 
details such as the location and age of the installations they purchase 
electricity from, as well the matching method used (see section 3.2). 

Inditex’s emission reduction measures cover most key areas but 
are not detailed enough to understand their potential significance. 
Inditex has targets and measures to reduce emissions from raw 
materials sourcing, including switching to “preferred materials” 
such as organic cotton and investing in innovative fibres that can 
substitute either cotton or fossil fuel-based fibres such as nylon 
(Inditex, 2023a, 2023b). However, the company does not present 
a clear estimate of what these measures would mean in terms of 
emission reduction. Inditex also has clear targets and measures 
to increase recycling and reusing its products and shows detailed 
information to help readers understand the order of magnitude of 
the current implementation of its measures today (Inditex, 2023b, 
2023a). Reaching deep decarbonisation will require fashion retailers 
to move away from a quantity-focused fast fashion business model 
to a less resource intensive production model. Inditex’s strategy 
includes a shift towards increasing the durability of its products, as 
well as increasing circularity of the materials used (Inditex, 2023b, 
2023a), but it stops short of estimating what the achievement of its 
climate targets will mean for its business volume and resource use.

Inditex plans to phase out coal from its supply chain, but is 
encouraging suppliers to move to bioenergy, which would have 
negative climate and environmental consequences. While Inditex 
states to encourage electrification of processes, where possible, the 
company also encourages suppliers to move to bioenergy in some 
processes. Inditex could be clearer about for which processes and 
in what situations it pursues bioenergy as a sustainable solution. 
If Inditex encourages suppliers to use bioenergy for processes 

that could be electrified, this can considerably undermine the 
significance of any renewable electricity targets set for the supply 
chain. While the IEA considers bioenergy a “renewable” energy 
source, the sustainable potential for bioenergy is very limited 
and should only be used for processes that cannot be electrified 
or otherwise served by modern renewable heat sources such 
as concentrated solar or geothermal energy [see discussion in 
section  3.3]. A substantial increase in demand for bioenergy will 
contribute to issues such as biodiversity loss, water pollution, land 
conflicts and an increase GHG emissions.  

Information on electricity use and renewable electricity targets 
in the supply chain is very limited, despite the high relevance of 
this emission source in Inditex’s overall value chain. A substantial 
share of emissions from manufacturing textiles derive from carbon-
intensive electricity use, so switching to renewable electricity in 
the supply chain is a critical measure in decarbonising the fashion 
industry (Berg et al., 2020; Ley et al., 2021; Sadowski et al., 2021). 
While Inditex’s GHG emission disclosure in 2022 indicated that 
over 94% of its full value chain emissions (excluding indirect 
use-phase emissions) derive from the company’s supply chain, 
we could not identify any quantitative estimates on electricity 
consumption within the supply chain, nor on renewable electricity 
generation or procurement instruments. The target for facilities in 
the supply chain to “increase the purchase and/or generation of 
electricity coming from 100% renewable sources” (Inditex, 2023a) 
is potentially misleading. This could be misunderstood as a target 
for 100% renewable electricity, although it only sets to increase 
the procurement of renewable energy to an undefined level and 
without a target year. In its 2023 sustainability report, Inditex 
includes a target to procure at least 50% of the electricity used 
for manufacturing processes in its supply chain from renewable 
sources by 2030, and 100% by 2040 (Inditex, 2024a, p. 201). 
However, it stops short of determining which procurement 
mechanisms will be used to achieve its target, which can greatly 
influence its integrity. Additionally, without a parallel commitment 
to electrify manufacturing processes, Inditex’s supply chain target 
leaves out a significant share of its emissions, especially those 
associated with the use of coal boilers.

The assessment is mostly based on the 2022 sustainability report; the information in the 2023 
sustainability report published in March 2024 was only considered when it led to changes in our evaluation.

N/A



Nike
Nike Inc. is a US-based multinational fashion retailer. It is 
one of the largest in the world by revenue, reaching USD 
51.2 billion in 2022. Like other large fashion retailers, Nike’s 
emissions stem mostly from its supply chain, especially from 
sourcing materials and manufacturing. Nike’s most prominent 
emission reduction targets imply a ~41% reduction by 2030 
below 2019 levels, which is almost aligned with 1.5°C 
compatible benchmarks for the fashion sector. It remains 
unclear to what extent Nike’s proposed measures will be 
sufficient to achieve its targets.

Nike’s 2030 targets imply a 41% reduction in total value 
chain emissions below 2019 levels, which is aligned with 
1.5°C compatible benchmarks for the fashion sector. The 
targets are prominently presented and all the relevant 
emissions data to understand their impact is available in 
the company’s own reports (Nike, 2023, p. 108). Nike’s 
scope 3 target does not include emissions from the use of 
sold products, which represent a significant share of the 
company’s total emissions. However, this is because these 
emissions stem mostly from the washing and drying of Nike’s 
products, over which the company has little control. This is 
an optional rather than a mandatory reporting category of the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, and its exclusion from the 
target is reasonable. Including these emissions in the target 
could be misleading, as major progress towards the targets 
could otherwise be achieved by the decarbonisation of the 
power grid and improvements in appliance efficiency, with 
little to no action from the company. Nike also set out a 2050 
net zero target which is not prominently presented, but rather 
only mentioned once at the end of its 2022 impact report 
(Nike, 2023, p. 182). The target implies a 91% reduction in 
total value chain emissions below 2019 levels, which meets 
1.5°C-compatible benchmarks for the fashion sector.

Nike’s strategy covers most of the key decarbonisation 
measures identified for the sector but lacks sufficient detail 
to understand their expected GHG impact. Nike commits to 
eliminating coal from its value chain by 2030 and it mentions 
potentially sustainable solutions such as the electrification of 
steam, but the company stops short of committing to non-
combustible sources of renewable power (e.g. wind, solar, 
hydro, and geothermal), leaving open the option of less 
sustainable energy solutions such as the use of biomass. The 
company also reports to engage with suppliers to increase 
energy efficiency, as well as on-site renewables and purchasing 
renewable energy. Nike mentions that it only plans to use 
standalone RECs or other certificates as a bridge measure 
until higher quality options are available. However, there is 
no associated target or commitment to increase the use of 
renewables in Nike’s supply chain, nor a clear commitment to 
move entirely away from low quality procurement constructs 
such as standalone RECs. Nike has targets to improve the 
GHG footprint of its materials, including a target to increase 
“preferred materials” to 50% of all materials by 2025, with an 
estimated 0.5 MtCO2e saving, and to reduce waste from the 
manufacturing process. Its strategy also covers other related 
aspects such as repairing and reselling used products but does 
not include associated targets. Finally, Nike’s strategy does not 
include information on other key aspects such as engagement 
with tier 4 suppliers (such as a farmers) to incentivise adoption 
of best practices, plans to invest in innovative materials, or 
plans to reduce (over)production.

Nike also set out a series of 2025 targets to reduce emissions 
in its own operations and to address some emission sources 
in its value chain. Its main targets are to reduce scope 1 
and 2 emissions by 70% below 2020 levels by 2025. Nike 
indicates that these targets will be achieved mostly through 
purchases of renewable electricity (Nike, 2023, p. 13). Other 
targets include to maintain emissions from manufacturing 
and transportation. The existence of short-term targets is a 
positive signal that the company is committed to immediate 
action. However, the significance of their targets will depend 
on the measures pursued to achieve them, especially related 
to the procurement of renewable electricity.

Nike claims that its operational electricity consumption 
derives 96% from renewable sources today, and aims for 100% 
by 2025 (Nike, 2024, p. 12), but the quality of procurement 
constructs remains unclear. Roughly a quarter of its renewable 
electricity demand is met by RECs and three quarters by PPAs 
(Nike, 2023, pp. 192–193). Only a relatively insignificant share 
of electricity demand today is generated with own capacity. 
Nike provides limited details on the PPA constructs, many 
of which appear to be established with generation facilities 
located in different countries to the location of consumption. 
Therefore, clarity is still lacking regarding the extent to which 
the PPAs lead to additional renewable electricity capacity on 
the grid, and the extent to which Nike’s claim of 93% renewable 
electricity is met by adequate constructs.

The assessment is based on the 2022 sustainability report; the information in the 2023 
sustainability report published in March 2024 does not lead to any changes in our evaluation.

113Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Food & agriculture8
8.1 Sector highlights

•	 Emissions from the food and agriculture companies assessed here mainly stem from 
upstream agricultural emissions (scope 3), from livestock (enteric fermentation), crop 
production, fertiliser production and application, and land-use change (deforestation). A large 
share of these emissions can be reduced by reducing animal-source food and increasing plant-
rich foods in diets, eliminating deforestation and minimising food loss and waste.

•	 We see an improvement in the quality of some food and agriculture companies’ 
emissions reporting and disclosure: some of the companies we assessed cover a larger 
share of their upstream and downstream value chain emissions in their disclosure. Public-
facing sustainability reports now generally include a breakdown of scope 3 emissions, 
highlighting the emissions-intensive nature of sourcing of ingredients.

•	 Four out of the five food and agriculture companies assessed here have targets that are 
aligned with SBTi’s FLAG guidance, which also means that the companies have separate 
targets for their energy and industry-related emissions and for their forest, land and 
agriculture (FLAG) emissions. In general, we see a reasonable level of long-term ambition 
for non-FLAG emissions among the assessed companies.

•	 For the FLAG targets, however, land sequestration CDR plays an undefined role, 
significantly undermining the real ambition level of some companies’ targets. Current 
guidance allows companies to aggregate emissions and removals, and allows for land 
sequestration CDR to count toward emission reduction targets, due to the difficulties of 
disaggregating emissions and sequestration in some agricultural sectors.

•	 The potentially significant role for land sequestration CDR obscures the lack of critical 
transition measures for emission reductions in the food and agriculture sector. Only one 
company presents a plan to increase the share of plant-based protein and products with a 
lower carbon footprint. The lack of real commitments to transition toward less emissions-
intensive business models, such as focusing on plant-based protein to reduce livestock 
herds, is not immediately clear from companies’ FLAG targets due to the significant 
potential role of CDR towards their emission reduction targets (see also section 3.4).

8.2 Sectoral transition framework
Food system emissions are estimated to account for almost a 
third of global emissions annually: 16 GtCO2e per year (Crippa 
et al., 2021; Boehm et al., 2023). A deep and rapid transition 
in the food system is crucial: even if fossil fuel emissions were 
to be eliminated immediately, global food system emissions 
alone would make it impossible to limit global warming to 
1.5°C (Clark et al., 2020). Against this backdrop, the IPCC’s 
Sixth Assessment Report states that a rapid decrease in food 
system emissions requires extensive and unprecedented 
actions from both the demand and supply sides.

Companies assessed here include food processors and 
retailers. Almost 90% such companies’ disclosed emissions 
are attributable to scope 3 emissions. The largest emission 
sources include livestock, crop cultivation, land use, and 
land-use change, so measures to reduce these emissions 
are crucial to limit warming to 1.5°C (T. C. Liu et al., 2023, 
p. 6). Major emissions generated from the food system 
include deforestation and land clearing, production and use 
of fertilizers and other agrichemicals, enteric fermentation 
during the production of ruminants (cows, sheep, goats), 
production of rice paddies, livestock manure and combustion 
of fossil fuels in food production and supply chains (Clark et al., 
2020). Relevant emission reduction strategies for the food and 
agriculture sector include (Roe et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020):

•	 Reducing the emissions from agricultural activities (with 
reducing emissions from enteric fermentation, synthetic 
fertilizer production, and rice cultivation being the main 
measures), 

•	 Halting deforestation and land degradation

•	 Shifting to regional, plant-based diets

•	 Lowering per capita calorie intake

•	 Increasing agricultural yields

•	 Reducing food loss and waste

•	 Enhancing soil carbon sequestration 

If these crucial measures are implemented with an accelerated 
pace, global food system emissions could reach net zero, or 
even reach net negative emissions, by 2050. This requires deep 
emission reductions of annually 3.3%, as well as exploiting 
the emission removals of the sector through extensive soil 
carbon sequestration, land restoration, pursuing agroforestry 
and improved land and forest management (Clark et al., 2020; 
Costa et al., 2022).

The livestock sector is responsible for 80% of global 
methane (CH4) emissions – a very potent greenhouse gas 
with an immediate warming effect – and for about 12% of 
anthropogenic warming to date (Reisinger et al., 2021). If 
current livestock expansion rates remain the same, emissions 
from land-use change could emit 6 GtCO2e/year by 2050, 
representing about 65% of total agricultural emissions 
(Searchinger et al., 2019, p. 23). By expanding into natural 
ecosystems, livestock systems are also a major driver of 
land-use change and deforestation, causing significant CO2 
emissions and biodiversity loss (Searchinger et al., 2019; 
Boehm et al., 2023, p. 105). Global pathways consistent with 
limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot call for 
livestock methane emissions to fall by 38% by 2050 relative 
to 2010 and continue to decline toward 2100 (Reisinger et al., 
2021). Failure to reduce livestock methane emissions would 
seriously impede the feasibility of limiting warming to 1.5°C. 
Dietary changes, such as adopting plant-rich diets will be 
essential to reduce methane emissions.

Various emissions benchmarks are presented in the literature. 
The lack of a single agreed-upon benchmark stems from 
the sector’s complexity and the need to balance multiple 
objectives such as emissions reductions, food security, farmer 
livelihoods, biodiversity, and emissions removals. The targets 
range from reducing absolute agricultural production emissions 
by 39% by 2050 compared to 2017 levels (Boehm et al., 2023, 
p. 126) to an 85% reduction in emissions by 2050 compared to 
2020 levels (Roe et al., 2019; Dietz and Jahn, 2024). The wide 
range of benchmarks is linked to differing assumptions around 
the role of land sequestration CDR, possible demand-side shifts 
related to diets, and certain measures’ technical potential. In 
1.5°C-aligned pathways, global residual emissions mainly 
persist in the food and agriculture sector, since reducing to 
zero emissions is not feasible with today’s known technologies 
and methods. Land sequestration CDR plays an important 
role – on a global scale – to get the sector’s emissions to net 
zero, but what roles emission reductions and removals should 
play in companies’ climate strategies remain unclear.

115Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Key actions and measures for the food and agriculture sector 
Measures to reduce methane emissions and emissions from livestock

Reduce animal-source food and increase plant-rich foods in diets
  Critical transitional measure

Reduce emissions from livestock
  Enabling measure 
Alongside the shift towards more plant-based diets, 
enabling measures to reduce the emissions of livestock 
directly are needed to already start reducing the emissions 
intensity. Existing measures include increasing feed quality, 
increasing meat productivity, and manure management. 
Novel technologies could help achieve further supply-side 
methane emissions reductions if cost and R&D constraints 
are overcome. These technologies include synthetic 
methane inhibitors, a methane vaccine (pending proof of 
concept), low-emissions breeding and the use of seaweed 
as a feed additive  (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 7). 

The most immediate measure to reduce livestock methane 
emissions due to enteric fermentation is a significant shift 
in protein consumption in high-consuming regions away 
from animal-based towards plant-based and alternative 
proteins with lower environmental impacts. It also frees up 
land, currently used for livestock systems, to be used for 
more carbon efficient uses without affecting food security 
(Reisinger et al., 2021). Literature provides various levels of 
reduction in meat and dairy consumption: Roe et al. (2021, p. 
825) describe a 50% adoption of plant-based diets by 2050, 
while Boehm et al. (2023, p. 125) illustrate that to be 1.5°C 
compatible, ruminant meat consumption needs to reduce 
from 91 kcal/capita/day in 2020 to 60 kcal/capita/day in 

2050, reducing overall consumption by 24%. Reducing 
animal-based food consumption by only 10% would nearly 
eliminate net cropland expansion (Searchinger et al., 2019, 
p. 80). While the shift to plant-based protein comes with 
many benefits, there are also social, economic, and cultural 
challenges related to it. It must entail a just transition for 
livestock farmers, as roughly 1.3 billion livelihoods depend 
on livestock systems  (Reisinger et al., 2021). Companies 
play a crucial role in influencing the availability, affordability, 
convenience and desirability of certain foods and the market 
for plant-based foods presents a strong business case 
(Searchinger et al., 2019, pp. 92–94; Bloomberg Intelligence, 
2021).

Measures to reduce emissions from the production of food (upstream scope 3) 

Global GHG emissions intensity of agricultural production need to decline by 31% by 2030 and 56% by 2050 relative to 2017 levels (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 126).

Removal measure: increase soil health for enhanced carbon sequestration   Critical transitional measure 
Alongside deep emissions reductions, the interest in the 
potential for soil carbon sequestration on working agricultural 
lands to remove emissions is growing. The potential mitigation 
impact of soil carbon sequestration can be significant (Costa et 
al., 2022), but the potential and its feasibility are still debated 
among researchers (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 126). The practices 
to increase carbon sequestration are often called ‘regenerative’ 
and include a range of measures such as erosion control, use of 
larger root plants, reduced tillage, restoration of degraded soils, 
and agroforestry (Roe et al., 2019, p. 825). Such practices can 
improve soil health, increase biodiversity, and reduce reliance 
on chemical inputs and pesticides while maintaining agricultural 
productivity in a changing climate (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 126).

Sustainably increase crop and livestock 
productivity on existing agricultural land
  Critical transitional measure 
More food and feed needs to be produced on existing 
agricultural lands while lowering the emissions intensity 
of agricultural production (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 124). 
Productivity can be increased through a range of measures. 
Some measures such as agroforestry can lead to increased 
crop yield compared to conventional farming methods 
on top of other positive ecological impacts (Kuyah et al., 
2019). When increasing productivity sustainably, the need 
to depend on emerging and uncertain measures, such as 
carbon sequestration, decreases (Costa et al., 2022, p. 5).

Added to the uncertainty and lack of data concerning 
soil carbon sequestration, ‘regenerative’ practices cannot 
replace other critical measures, especially regarding ruminant 
emissions. Recent studies show that reducing emissions 
intensity for ruminants through soil carbon sequestration 
is overly optimistic (Wang et al., 2023). Hence, emission 
reduction measures remain of the upmost importance; it 
is most appropriate to adopt separate emission reduction 
and emission removal.

116Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Shift away from the use of fossil fuels in the food and agriculture supply chain
  Enabling measure 
The current food system is responsible for approximately 30% of the world’s energy consumption 
(T. C. Liu et al., 2023, p. 4). Scaling renewable energy, enhancing fuel efficiency, electrifying 
transport fleets, and improving synthetic fertiliser production are all necessary measures for 
shifting the current food systems away from fossil fuels. Nitrogen fertiliser production and use 
represent approximately 5% of global GHG emissions (Gao and Serrenho, 2023).

Measures to reduce food loss and waste (upstream and downstream scope 3) 

Reduce the share of food production lost or wasted by 50% by 2030 compared to 
2016 levels, and maintain these levels through 2050    Critical transitional measure 
About 24% of food is lost or wasted between production and consumption each year, causing 
unnecessarily higher levels of production and landfill emissions (Searchinger et al., 2019, p. 52; 
Boehm et al., 2023, p. 124). Therefore, reducing food loss and waste is a crucial measure to limit 
the growth in demand for agricultural goods (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 124). Food loss occurs during 
the production, post-harvest and processing stages, whereas food waste occurs when safe food 
is discarded from the retail store to the point of intended consumption (Searchinger et al., 2019, 
p. 53). Corporations play an important role as a lot of downstream consumer waste takes place 
in restaurants and retail markets, not just homes. Companies can fight food loss by engaging 
with their suppliers to reduce waste and implementing food loss and waste programs (Boehm 
et al., 2023, p. 138). Food waste can also be reduced through improvements to infrastructure 
or innovative methods to sell food that would otherwise be wasted (Clark et al., 2020).

Reduce emissions from cooling and refrigeratio
(scope 1 for food retailers, scope 3 for food producers)

Reduce the use of HFCs and switch to climate friendly refrigerants
  Enabling transitional measure 
In order to avoid food losses and waste while global temperatures are rising, refrigeration will be 
increasingly important. Currently, the most commonly used refrigerants are hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), which have high global warming potentials (Roberts, 2017). About 40% of refrigerant 
and cooling emissions can be avoided by 2030 by using low global warming potential natural 
refrigerants (Green Cooling Initiative, 2015, p. 7). Alternative refrigerants with low or zero 
global warming potential are available on the market but currently face financial and technical 
challenges to rapid uptake (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 55).

8.3 Danone

118Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Danone
Danone S.A. is a French corporation that mainly produces 
dairy and dairy products. The largest share of its emissions 
occurs in scope 3, with purchased goods and services, mainly 
related to milk and dairy ingredients, accounting for 75% 
of its value chain emissions in 2022. Danone has a net-zero 
target for 2050 and committed to emissions reductions of 
34.7% by 2030. Due to a limited scope coverage, the latter 
target translates to emission reduction of 30% compared to 
the full value chain emissions in 2019. This is almost in line 
with 1.5°C-aligned benchmarks for the sector. Furthermore, 
the company plans to increase its share of plant-based 
protein production and has a target to reduce its methane 
emissions by 30% by 2030.

Though some emission sources are not covered by Danone’s 
targets, the company’s short-term targets reflect the need 
for a rapid emission reduction in the sector. Danone has 
emission reduction targets for 2030 that cover a selected share 
of emissions: some minor scope 3 emissions categories are 
excluded, summing to roughly 5.7 MtCO2e, equivalent to 20% of 
2019 value chain emissions (Danone, 2020a, pp. 73–90, 2023b, 
p. 14). Besides presenting the baseline emissions and absolute 
targeted emission levels, the company does not make the scope 
exclusion explicit in its latest Climate Transition Plan, which limits 
the transparency of Danone’s climate strategy. Danone’s short-
term climate strategy includes various targets, with different 
levels of ambition for different emission sources (Danone, 2023b, 
p. 16). When assuming the excluded emission sources remain 
constant until 2030, the company’s targets translate to 30% of 
emission reductions by 2030, compared to 2019 reported value 
chain emissions. With this, Danone’s targets are almost in line 
with 1.5°C benchmarks for the food and agriculture, but the 
company could improve the transparency around excluding a 
share of emissions (see Annex II).

Although Danone does not have an emission reduction target 
as part of its net-zero target, the company estimates that its 
residual emissions will be 4.5 MtCO2e in 2050 and wants to 
“neutralise” those with carbon credits or ‘insetting’ (Danone, 
2023b, p. 38). The estimated residual emissions imply 
emission reductions of roughly 80%, compared to its 2020 
baseline emissions. When comparing to 2019 value chain 
emissions, assuming the aforementioned emissions outside 

the target’s coverage stay at a constant level of 5.7 MtCO2e, 
the emission reductions are roughly 64%. Danone describes 
that it will either purchase carbon credits to reach net zero, 
or realise land sequestration carbon dioxide removals through 
own projects (which is also referred to as ‘insetting’ by others) 
(Danone, 2023b, p. 38). Danone does not describe in much 
detail what kind of projects it will depend on, but mentions 
land sequestration carbon dioxide removals and carbon 
capture without further specification (Danone, 2023b, p. 
38). Nonetheless, the implied plan for emission reductions of 
roughly 64% would be almost in line with sectoral benchmarks 
for the food and agriculture sector. 

In its Climate Transition Plan, Danone presents potentially 
comprehensive emissions reduction measures, including plans 
to increase the share of plant-based protein (Danone, 2023b, 
pp. 18; 35). This measure strengthens the integrity of Danone’s 
longer-term climate strategy. Since the implementation of 
Danone’s planned measures for the short-term would mean 
reaching the technical and physical limitations of methane 
reductions in the livestock sector without reducing dairy 
production, increasing the share of plant-based protein is a 
crucial additional measure to reach deeper levels of emission 
reductions (Reisinger et al., 2021). Danone describes the 
importance of dairy for “healthy, sustainable and accessible 
diets” (Danone, 2023c, p. 4), but also highlights its plans 
to further increase the share of plant-based and low-
carbon products (Danone, 2023b, pp. 35–36). Our current 
understanding of Danone’s goal to make low-carbon products 
its main source of business is that it entails a reduction in 
livestock and absolute dairy production, but Danone could 
clarify this further. Given the uncertainty, the developments 
regarding Danone’s dairy production and livestock volumes 
need to be closely monitored. By increasing the share of plant-
based protein production, the company creates an opportunity 
to transition away from an emissions-intensive business model 
and to achieve deeper emission reductions in the longer term.

Danone’s climate strategy includes a target to reduce methane 
emissions related to fresh milk production by 30%, compared 
to 2020 levels (Danone, 2023c, p. 3). Danone is a signatory 
to the Global Methane Pledge, and even though the company 
does not report on methane emissions yet, it is commendable 
that Danone is one of the first major agrifood companies to 
set a target for reducing methane emissions, which is one of 
the most challenging and critical emission sources of the sector  
(Reisinger et al., 2021). During COP28, Danone pledged to start 
reporting on its methane emissions in 2024 (Douglas, 2023).

8.4 Mars

120Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Mars
Mars Incorporated, headquartered in the US, is a private 
company that produces confectionary and pet food and 
provides animal care services. Almost three-quarters of 
reported emissions occur in upstream scope 3, mainly from 
agriculture and land-use change. Mars has a net-zero target 
for 2050 which includes an emission reduction commitment 
of 80%, and a 2030 emission reduction target of 50%. The 
company presents its 2030 target with a range of emission 
reduction measures that appear aligned with the targeted 
level, independent of measures for land sequestration carbon 
dioxide removals. Mars’s ambition in the short-term is in line 
with 1.5°C-benchmarks, but the company does not present an 
emission reduction strategy for after 2030. More details on its 
net-zero strategy as well as regular reporting would improve 
the transparency of the company’s climate plans.

Mars’s targets up to 2030 are in line with sectoral and global 
1.5°C-aligned benchmarks. Mars has emission reduction 
targets for 2025 and 2030 of 27% and 50% respectively, 
compared to 2015 levels (Mars, 2023d, p. 12, 2023c, p. 8). 
These targets also translate to 27% and 50% compared to 
2019 value chain emissions and are in line with benchmarks for 
the global food sector (see Annex II). They signal the need for a 
rapid decrease in Mars’s value chain emissions and represent 
commitments to real emission reductions: the company 
explicitly states that the targets do not depend on offsets 
or carbon sequestration on farms (Mars, 2023c, p. 26). The 
company does support enhanced land sequestration carbon 
dioxide removal (CDR), but states it will not use those removals 
for target realisation (Mars, 2023a). By providing this explicit 
clarification and confirming the integrity of its ambition, Mars 
acknowledges the current accounting limitations of CDR and 
prioritises deep emission reductions over contentious removal 
claims, while other companies are extensively counting on land 
sequestration CDR towards their more ambiguous targets.

In its net-zero roadmap, Mars presents a diverse set of 
emission reduction measures until 2030, which appear in 
line with the targeted emission levels. The presentation of 
measures is moderately transparent and well-structured. Mars 
presents the emission reduction potential of seven emission 
sources and divides them into 21 emission reduction measures 
(Mars, 2023c, pp. 25–32). The company presents a business-as-

usual scenario and targeted emissions of each emission source, 
as well as the emission reduction potential of each measure. 
However, the descriptions of measures are generally vague and 
often lack detail. Acknowledging that its deforestation-related 
emissions are significant, Mars describes the most significant 
reductions for agriculture and land-use change, with halting 
deforestation related to cocoa production being the most 
important measure (Mars, 2023c, p. 28), accounting for almost 
a quarter of the total emission reduction potential. Increased 
use of renewable electricity across Mars’s value chain also plays 
a significant role in the company’s strategy (Mars, 2023c, pp. 
25–33), which accounts for almost a fifth of the total emission 
reduction potential, mainly to reduce scope 3 emissions. Mars 
presents emission reduction measures that can – in total – 
reduce the company’s value chain emissions by more than the 
desired 50% by 2030 (Mars, 2023c, pp. 25–32). 

It remains unclear how Mars plans to reduce emissions further 
after 2030. Although Mars’s strategy until 2030 appears to 
be aligned with 1.5°C benchmarks, significant gaps remain 
for after 2030, both in terms of emission reduction measures 
as well as targets. The measures that Mars presents appear 
to have limited emission reduction potential beyond 2030; 
deeper emission reductions would be dependent on the 
implementation of other measures, which may be very difficult 
to implement at a later stage if not already planned for now. 
For example, Mars does not present any plans to meaningfully 
reduce emissions related to dairy production (Mars, 2023c, p. 
27), which likely makes up a substantial part of the agricultural 
emissions. This emission source requires the initiation of a 
transition soon, in order to ensure deep emission reductions 
by 2050. More information on Mars’s longer-term emission 
reduction strategy is needed for a thorough and fair assessment 
of the company’s 2050 target.

Mars’s net-zero target is substantiated with an 80% emission 
reduction target, but potential reliance on land sequestration 
CDR leaves the integrity of this target unclear. By specifying 
that the net-zero target means a reduction of at least 80% of 
its value chain emissions, Mars indicates a long-term ambition 
that could be in line with sectoral benchmarks (Mars, 2023c, 
p. 9). However, while Mars rules out the use of CDR towards 
its 2030 targets, the company does not specify whether CDR 
could play a role in achieving the 80% of emission reductions by 

2050. Still, if Mars maintains its planned reductions of 50% until 
2050, the emission reductions might be in line with sectoral 
benchmarks, regardless of the use of CDR.

Renewable electricity is key to Mars’s emission reduction 
strategy, mainly to reduce scope 3 emissions, but the company 
only provides little information on planned procurement 
constructs. Mars describes its ambition to include 100% 
renewable energy by 2040 (Mars, 2023d, p. 12), but also 
reports to have reached its limit for onsite wind and solar 
capacity (Mars, 2023c, p. 33). The company states that it plans 
to use more PPAs but does not provide any more details on 
this, nor on the measures it will take to support the use of 
renewable electricity in the supply chain (Mars, 2023c, p. 33). 
More information is needed to assess whether this will lead to 
real and meaningful emission reductions.

Mars does not regularly and publicly report on all of the most 
relevant sustainability indicators. Mars’s disclosure of today’s 
emission reduction practices and emissions is minimal. Its public-
facing annual sustainability report does not include a disclosure 
of emissions or other relevant data (Mars, 2023d, pp. 12–15). 
Mars only disclosed its emissions in its one-time publication 
presenting its net-zero roadmap (Mars, 2023c, p. 10); it only 
reports thorough data on a regular basis through its non-public 
CDP responses. The lack of regular public-facing reporting limits 
a thorough understanding of the company’s emissions trends 
and efficacy of existing and future emission reduction measures.

122Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Nestlé
Switzerland-based Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) is the world’s largest 
food and beverage company by revenue, with brands such as 
KitKat, Nesquik, and Nespresso. The biggest share of Nestlé’s 
emissions is related to agricultural activities. Nestlé commits 
to reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, and published 
new targets aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) guidance in 2023. 
Although these updates could mark an improvement in 
Nestlé’s climate strategy, Nestlé’s targets remain potentially 
misleading and ambiguous due to an unspecified amount 
of land sequestration carbon dioxide removals within the 
value chain, referred to as “carbon scope 3 removals”. Nestlé 
did not publish updated baseline emissions for its 2030 
target, so we continue to interpret that the pledge to reduce 
emissions by 50% by 2030 translates to emission reductions 
of just 16–24% based on measures presented in its Net Zero 
Roadmap, which does not include clear plans for the deep 
decarbonisation of agricultural emissions.

Key developments over the past year: Nestlé updated its 
2030 and 2050 net-zero pledge since the previous iteration 
of this analysis in February 2023 (Day, Mooldijk, Hans, et 
al., 2023), aligning its pledge with the SBTi FLAG guidance 
(SBTi, 2022a). These updates represent only minor changes 
compared to the information previously assessed. Hence, 
we did not identify any improvements on the key issues that 
undermine Nestlé’s climate strategy. 

Nestlé’s emission reduction pledges may be misleading. 
We interpret that the pledge to reduce emissions by 50.4% 
by 2030 translates to only 16–24% emission reductions 
compared to the company’s emissions in 2019. Nestlé’s 
SBTi-certified targets include emission reduction targets of 
20% by 2025 and 50.4% by 2030, with 2018 as a base year, 
which marks a very slight increase from its previous 50% 
target. The company now presents a separate 50% reduction 
target in FLAG emissions by 2030 (SBTi, 2023e; Nestlé, 
2024, p. 12). In its Net Zero Roadmap, Nestlé presents its 
interim emission reduction targets for each emission source 
compared to a business-as-usual scenario, showing the 
targeted emission levels for each emission source for 2030 
(Nestlé, 2023b, p. 4). We calculate from the figures presented 
in the company’s Net Zero Roadmap that its commitments 

translate to just a 16% reduction of the company’s full value 
chain emissions in 2019, or a maximum of 24% under the 
most optimistic interpretation (see further details on the 
target and this calculation in Annex II).

Nestlé’s 2050 net-zero pledge remains ambiguous due 
to limited scope coverage and an unspecified role of land 
sequestration carbon dioxide removals. Based on the 
company’s Net Zero Roadmap, we have calculated that Nestlé’s 
2050 net-zero pledge covers 81.4% of Nestlé’s 2018 emissions 
footprint (Nestlé, 2023b, pp. 6–8). However, it is not clear if this 
can be the right baseline, since this would in theory fall short 
of SBTi requirements for net-zero targets to cover at least 90% 
of a company’s emissions. Nestlé did not publish its updated 
baseline emissions for 2018 alongside its new SBTi FLAG 
targets, but does present the covered emissions of more recent 
reporting years in its latest sustainability report (Nestlé, 2024, p. 
8). The company does not provide a comparison with full value-
chain emissions of 2018. The updated net-zero pledge now 
includes a 90% emissions reduction commitment for industry- 
and energy-related emissions and a 75% emission reduction 
target for FLAG emissions by 2050 (Nestlé, 2024, p. 12), but the 
latter includes an undefined role for land sequestration carbon 
dioxide removals (CDR). Further clarification on the role of land 
sequestration CDR is needed to understand whether the 2050 
pledge represents a commitment that will lead to permanent, 
deep emission reductions. This is particularly relevant given 
the extensive role for CDR vis-à-vis emission reductions in the 
company’s plan for implementing its 2030 target.

Nestlé states that it “will not rely on offsetting” (Nestlé, 
2023a, p. 12) and does not refer to ‘insetting’ anymore, but 
will rely on land sequestration CDR for its target realisation 
and makes emission removals claims today.  Although 
the company says it will not rely on offsetting for target 
realisation, it also describes that Nestlé’s brands do purchase 
carbon credits for their “consumer engagement strategy”, 
without specifying what exact claims are being made with 
those (Nestlé, 2023b, p. 41).  Without further information 
on the volume and projects supported as well as the claims 
being made, it is not clear whether this alternative approach 
constitutes credible climate contributions or a repackaging 
of potentially misleading claims with new terminologies. The 
company continues to claim the neutralisation of emissions 

through land sequestration CDR taking place within its value 
chain in its public-facing documents, though to a lower extent. 
Nestlé claimed to have removed 4.3 MtCO2e in 2022 (Nestlé, 
2023a, p. 12), but presents removals of only 0.76 MtCO2e in 
2023 (Nestlé, 2024, p. 7). The company no longer describes 
removals as ‘insetting’, but as “carbon scope 3 removals” and 
“natural climate solutions”  (Nestlé, 2023b, pp. 20, 39–41, 
45). The company presents plans to remove 25.2 MtCO2e 
of land sequestration CDR by 2030: 13 MtCO2e through 
undefined “carbon scope 3 removals”, and 12.2 MtCO2e land 
sequestration CDR measures presented alongside emission 
reduction measures (Nestlé, 2023b, pp. 14, 19). This volume 
equates almost a quarter of 2018 value chain emissions.

Nestlé’s plans do not include sufficiently transformational 
measures to achieve deep decarbonisation of agricultural 
emissions in the long run. The majority of Nestlé’s GHG 
emissions derive from upstream agricultural activities. The 
agriculture sector faces major challenges for decarbonisation; 
existing technologies and measures to mitigate the emissions 
intensity of many agricultural products have limited potential, 
especially for the livestock sector, which accounted for a 
quarter of Nestlé’s reported emissions in 2023 (Nestlé, 2024, 
p. 7). Although Nestlé’s range of emission reduction measures 
are expected to lead to a respectable 48% reduction of 
manufacturing emissions by 2030, they will reduce emissions 
from dairy, livestock, soil, and forests, which are far more 
significant emission sources, by just 6% between 2018 and 2030, 
excluding measures to claim that emissions are offset through 
land sequestration CDR (Nestlé, 2023b, pp. 14, 19, 20). These 
emission sources represent the most significant challenge for 
agri-businesses. It is not credible for agri-businesses to claim 
that they are on a path to deep decarbonisation without major 
innovations to drastically reduce the emissions footprint of 
livestock agriculture or diversifying away from this highly GHG 
emissions intensive industry.

8.6 Tesco

124Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Tesco
Tesco PLC is a UK-based groceries multinational and general 
retailer. Almost 90% of Tesco’s emissions occur in scope 3: 
roughly 50% of its emissions footprint is related to purchased 
goods and services, mainly stemming from the production of 
the products the retailer sells, and almost 40% from the use of 
its sold products. Tesco‘s headline pledge is to reach net-zero 
emissions across its value chain by 2050. In the short term, the 
company mainly focuses on scope 1 and 2 targets, which will 
not lead to meaningful reductions in its value chain emissions. 
Moreover, partial exclusions of scope 3 emissions in its short- 
and medium-term targets are not transparently communicated. 
Tesco’s long-term targets for non-FLAG emissions appear 
reasonably ambitious, but the company does not specify the 
potentially significant role of land sequestration carbon dioxide 
removals for its FLAG targets. It remains unclear how the 
company plans to realise these targets: its emission reduction 
strategy lacks detail and the presented measures are unlikely to 
lead to deep emission reductions.

Tesco focuses disproportionally on scope 1 and 2 in its 
emission reduction strategy and emissions disclosure; the 
company does not have any targets that will lead to deep 
emission reductions in the short term. The most important 
reason for the latter is that Tesco does not have any emission 
reduction targets for scope 3 before 2032 (Tesco, 2024). Tesco’s 
climate strategy until 2030 focuses on scope 1 and 2, whereby 
these scopes account for only 2% of value chain emissions 
(Tesco, 2023a, pp. 103–115). This focus is also reflected in 
the company’s public-facing emissions disclosure, where less 
than 1% of scope 3 emissions are presented – covering only 
emissions related to business travel and a selected share of 
transport and distribution (Tesco, 2023b, pp. 19; 23). Tesco’s 
targets until 2030 translate to emission reductions of 1% by 
2030, compared to 2019 value chain emissions.

Tesco’s emission reduction targets for the medium-term cover 
only a share of total emissions, which is not transparently 
communicated. Tesco’s targets are to reduce non-Forest, Land, 
and Agriculture (FLAG) scope 3 emissions by 55% and FLAG-
related emissions by 39%, by 2032 and compared to a 2019 
baseline (Tesco, 2024). However, Tesco covers only 67% of 
baseline emissions with both targets (Tesco, 2023a, pp. 47–58). 
Due to these scope exclusions, we estimate that Tesco’s targets 

would translate to emission reductions somewhere in the range 
of 27-45% compared to 2019 value chain emissions. Tesco 
specifies the scope exclusions only in its CDP disclosure and 
not in its public-facing communication on its climate strategy 
(Tesco, 2023a, pp. 47–60). The public-facing targets imply a 
higher level of ambition than they entail in reality.

Tesco presents its emission reduction plans with a very limited 
level of detail, and it is not clear how the presented measures 
can lead to deep emission reductions. The company presents 
only a few emission reduction measures in broad terms, and 
the measures that target scope 3 mainly put the responsibility 
with others. Tesco hopes that suppliers and consumers will 
undertake extensive action, without indicating intent to 
provide extensive support or requirements (Tesco, 2023b, p. 
24). Currently, the company shows little to no commitment to 
implementing emission reduction measures that would be of 
high relevance for a retailer with significant FLAG emissions, 
such as commitments to increase the share of plant-based 
protein sales or a deforestation-free supply chain Tesco 
describes measures to improve health- and biodiversity-related 
aspects of its environmental impact more extensively on its 
climate change webpage (Tesco, 2024). The company states it 
will publish a transition plan in 2024 (Tesco, 2023a, p. 73).

Tesco presents emission reduction commitments of 72% and 
90% for FLAG and non-FLAG emissions respectively alongside 
its net-zero pledge (Tesco, 2024), where the latter represents 
a reasonable level of ambition, but the former remains 
ambiguous. Since Tesco’s non-FLAG emissions account for 
almost two-thirds of its emissions footprint, a large share of its 
emissions is subject to the reasonably ambitious 90% emission 
reduction target. For the FLAG emissions, however, we find 
that the limited scope coverage and likely dependence on land 
sequestration carbon dioxide removals, as explicitly allowed in 
SBTi’s FLAG guidance, reduces the potential emission reduction 
commitment substantially. As for Tesco’s medium-term targets, 
the targets’ baseline emissions of scope 3 categories 3 (fuel 
and energy-related activities) and 11 (use of sold products) 
differ significantly from the emissions reported elsewhere. 
Scope exclusions and the related transparency issues lead us 
to estimate that the targets translate to an emission reduction 
range of 63-74% in 2050. These estimates partially rely on an 
undefined role of land sequestration carbon dioxide removals 

that will reduce the real emission reduction commitment 
even further. Tesco claims that these targets are in line with 
SBTi’s FLAG guidance and Net Zero Standard, but it remains 
uncertain whether the limited scope coverage is in line with the 
requirements presented in those guides.

126Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Walmart
Walmart Inc. (Walmart) is a US-based retail corporation 
that operates grocery stores, department stores, and 
hypermarkets. Most of Walmart’s emissions (94% of 2022 
emissions) originate from the procurement of goods (upstream 
scope 3). Walmart has set targets to take responsibility for its 
operational scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, its strategy 
for upstream scope 3 emissions, which account for most of 
the company’s overall climate impact, lacks a clear reduction 
commitment. Walmart sets no emissions reduction target 
for scope 3 emissions but rather builds on Project Gigaton, a 
programme in which Walmart engages with its suppliers to set 
targets and reduce emissions themselves voluntarily. Walmart 
does not have a separate target for FLAG emissions.

Key developments over the past year: We could identify 
only minor changes to Walmart’s sustainability strategy since 
our previous analysis of the case study in the 2023 Corporate 
Climate Responsibility Monitor (Day, Mooldijk, Hans, et al., 2023). 
The company states it no longer anticipates reaching its 2025 
emissions reduction target and does not provide an explanation 
for this setback, putting into question the credibility of its scope 
1 and 2 emissions targets. Walmart has continued to increase 
the number of suppliers signed up to its Project Gigaton 
engagement programme to reduce upstream scope 3 emissions. 
Since the publication of its scope 1 and 2 SBTi targets in 2016, 
Walmart has made no progress in target ambition, despite 
the critical insufficiency of these targets in the context of the 
climate crisis now many years later. Accordingly, only minor 
modifications were made to this case study.

Walmart has not updated its highly insufficient targets since 
launching them in 2016; its targets still cover a negligible 
share of emissions. Walmart’s headline target is to reduce 
its scope 1 and 2 emissions, referred to as ‘operational 
emissions’, to zero by 2040, complemented by interim targets 
for 2025 and 2030. The company does not seek to offset 
emissions and commits to sourcing 100% renewable energy in 
global operations (scope 1 and 2) by 2035 (Walmart, 2023b).  
Walmart has set interim emission reduction targets for its 
scope 1 and 2 emissions: reductions of 35% by 2025 and 65% 
by 2030, compared to a 2015 baseline (Walmart, 2022a, p. 
28). The targets translate to approximately a 25% emission 
reduction from scopes 1 and 2 by 2025 and 60% by 2030, 

from a 2019 baseline. Including scope 3 emissions, the targets 
translate to only a 5% emission reduction by 2030 and 9% 
by 2050, compared to 2019 levels (Walmart, 2023c, p. 19). 
In addition to the very limited level of ambition embodied by 
these targets, their credibility is further called into question 
by Walmart’s announcement in 2023 that it anticipates being 
unable to reach its 2025 target (Walmart, 2023b). 

In 2017, Walmart launched Project Gigaton to address 
scope 3 emissions, which account for 94% of the company’s 
emissions footprint, but the potential impact of the measures 
remains unclear. To address scope 3 emissions, the company 
launched its Project Gigaton in 2017. Through Project Gigaton, 
Walmart wants to engage suppliers, offering them guidance to 
reduce their emissions in six areas: energy, nature, product use 
and design, waste, packaging, and transportation (Walmart, 
2023c, p. 20). Suppliers can sign up for the programme and 
receive access to resources and training that help them 
set their own targets and design strategies to tackle their 
emissions. The project includes key sector reduction measures 
such as sourcing 20 relevant commodities ‘more sustainably’ 
by 2025 using various certifications to guarantee the level of 
sustainability. However, it remains unclear what impact these 
measures will have on its scope 3 emissions (Walmart, 2023c, 
p. 18). Measures concerning renewable energy procurement 
under Project Gigaton are more transparent. To increase the 
share of renewable electricity in its supply chain, Walmart 
supports suppliers to access collaborative Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) (Schneider Electric, 2022) (see Section 3.2). 
Since 2017, around 5,200 suppliers have joined the programme 
(Walmart, 2023c, p. 20); while these suppliers account for 12% 
of all suppliers, they account for roughly 75% of US net sales 
(Walmart, 2023d, p. 96), an increase from last year’s 4,500 
suppliers (Walmart, 2022). With Project Gigaton, Walmart 
aims to reduce 1 GtCO2e in cumulative scope 3 emissions in 
the period between 2017 and 2030. The progress of Project 
Gigaton is measured through avoided CO2e emissions, using 
a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario as a baseline (Walmart, 
2023a, p. 4). Walmart notes that this approach for calculating 
progress does not align with GHG Protocol’s Corporate Value 
Chain Standard. As we were unable to identify the variables 
included in Walmart’s BAU calculations, we could not evaluate 
to what extent reported progress compares to real emissions 
reductions. Although Project Gigaton is presented as a central 

element of Walmart’s sustainability strategy, the company 
did not commit to any targets for scope 3 emissions. How 
the cumulative emission reductions are aligned with a 1.5°C 
trajectory remains unclear.

Walmart’s public-facing reporting neglects a large share of 
emissions; Walmart can improve its GHG emissions reporting 
to ensure transparency and accountability. In its public 
climate change strategy, the company does not disclose its 
scope 3 emissions, which account for 94% of the company’s 
total emissions in 2022 (Walmart, 2023d, pp. 59–67). In 
its CDP disclosure, Walmart partially reports on its scope 3 
emissions: a share of downstream scope 3 emissions are being 
recalculated (Walmart, 2023d). Furthermore, its main reporting 
of emissions from energy procurement (scope 2) uses a market-
based accounting approach. This reduced energy procurement 
emissions by more than 3 MtCO2e in 2022 compared to a 
location-based accounting approach. Scope 3 and location-
based scope 2 emission estimates are only included in Walmart’s 
disclosure to CDP, which the company makes publicly accessible 
by publishing it on its website (Walmart, 2023d, pp. 56–67); not 
in its public-facing sustainability documentation.

Walmart commits not to use offsets to reach its target for 
zero operational emissions, while pledging to make a climate 
contribution to support nature-based solutions without 
claiming to neutralise its emissions. Walmart explicitly plans 
to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions to zero by 2040, without 
the use of offsets (Walmart, 2021a). In parallel, Walmart and 
Walmart Foundation have committed to protect or restore 50 
million acres of land by 2030, without linking this contribution 
to a neutralisation claim (Walmart, 2020a). This is an effective 
approach to supporting nature-based solutions for climate 
change mitigation outside of its value chain. However, Walmart 
could improve their transparency on these contributions 
by disclosing further information on how it determines the 
volume of support. It remains unclear whether this is linked 
to assuming responsibility for unabated emissions, particularly 
given that scope 3 emissions are not included in Walmart's 
main climate targets.

High-hanging fruit The high-hanging fruit of mitigation potential refers to 
the technologies and measures to decarbonise emission 
sources that remain otherwise entirely inaccessible to host 
country governments in the near- and mid-term future, on 
account of high costs or other insurmountable barriers that 
cannot reasonably be overcome.

Insetting ‘Insetting’ is a business-driven concept used by a limited 
number of actors with no universally accepted definition. 
Insetting is often described as offsetting within the value 
chain. The approach can lead to low credibility GHG 
emission offsetting claims and presents a significant risk 
of double counting the same emission reductions.

Integrity (rating) The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor assesses 
the transparency and integrity of companies’ climate 
pledges. Integrity, in this context, is a measure of the 
quality, credibility and comprehensiveness of a company’s 
approaches towards the various elements of corporate 
climate responsibility.

Location-based method (for scope 
2 emissions accounting)

The location-based method for scope 2 emissions 
accounting reflects the average emission intensity of 
the electricity grid from which the consumer’s energy 
is delivered. 

Market-based method (for scope 2 
emissions accounting)

The market-based method for scope 2 emissions 
accounting reflects the emissions from electricity 
generation specifically procured by the consumer (which 
may not reflect the electricity they actually consume from 
a grid that features multiple buyers and sellers). It derives 
emission factors from contractual renewable electricity 
procurement instruments.

Nationally determined 
contributions (NDCs)

Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are the pledges 
made by national governments to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change to mitigate 
climate change. The Paris Agreement requires all Parties 
to submit and regularly update their NDCs to represent 
their possible highest level of ambition. Recognising the 
insufficiency of climate change mitigation commitments 
in existing NDCs, the Glasgow Pact from COP26 urged 
all Parties to update their NDCs again ahead of COP27.

Neutralisation Fundamentally, companies’ plans to neutralise emissions 
towards net zero targets constitute a form of offsetting. 
Nevertheless, we recognise an emerging consensus that 
the terminology ‘neutralisation’ is differentiated by other 
forms of offsetting on the basis that it should apply only 
to residual emissions.

Non-GHG climate forcers Non-GHG climate forcers include the emission of gases 
and aerosols, and processes that change cloud abundance, 
leading to radiative forcing. Radiative forcing is a change 
in the balance of radiation in the atmosphere, which 
contributes to global warming. For example, the non-
GHG climate forcers are estimated to increase the climate 
impact of GHG emissions from the aviation industry by a 
factor of approximately 3 (Atmosfair, 2016).

Offsetting See carbon credits.

Permanence (of CDR) The permanence of a CDR outcome refers to the timescale 
and degree to which sequestered carbon remains stored 
and not released into the atmosphere.

Power purchase agreement (PPA) A PPA is a long-term contract between an electricity 
provider and an electricity consumer, usually spanning 
10-20 years. The consumer agrees to purchase a certain 
amount of electricity from a specific asset under a pre-
determined pricing arrangement. PPAs are generally signed 
with new renewable energy installations and form part of 
the project investment decision (NewClimate Institute and 
Data-Driven EnviroLab, 2020). PPAs can also be signed 
for existing installations, in which case it is less likely the 
PPA results in additional renewable electricity capacity. 
However, it may be that existing installations would cease 
operations if the operator cannot sign a new PPA.

Renewable energy certificate (REC) Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are also known 
under various names, such as Guarantees of Origin (GOs) or 
Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). RECs can be acquired 
simply as an accounting tool alongside other renewable 
electricity procurement constructs, or may be procured 
as “standalone RECs”. 

Standalone RECs: The procurement of RECs without 
any accompanying renewable electricity procurement 
construct, such as a PPA.

Residual emissions Residual emissions are the remaining GHG emissions 
from hard-to-abate emission sources where no known 
feasible options remain for further decarbonisation. (See 
also unabated emissions)

Scarcity (of CDR) The maximum potential of most carbon dioxide removal 
measures is technically limited, and even further restricted 
by environmental constraints. Due to issues such as land 
requirements, high water consumption, high energy 
consumption, land degradation and pollution, among other 
environmental costs, carbon dioxide removal technologies 
can only be scaled-up so far without significantly 
endangering sustainable development goals, including 
food security. The scarcity of carbon dioxide removals 
measures – in terms of their maximum absolute or annual 
technical potential – is an important consideration when 
evaluating the feasibility of net-zero claims at the level 
of individual actors. Robust future use of scarce carbon 
dioxide removal options must be consistent with achieving 
net-zero and eventually net-negative emissions at the 
global level, which is required to avoid the most damaging 
effects of climate change over the coming decades.

Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi)

SBTi reviews and certifies the climate targets of companies 
who join the initiative as members. Companies’ climate 
targets are certified as 1.5°C or 2°C compatible if they align 
with SBTi’s own methodology and benchmarks.

Scope (of GHG emissions) The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard classifies a 
company’s GHG emissions into three ‘scopes’ (WBCSD 
and WRI, 2004):

Scope 1 emissions Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or 
controlled sources.

Scope 2 emissions Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the 
generation of purchased energy (see also location-based 
method and market-based method).

130Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Scope 3 emissions

Upstream scope 3 emission sources

Downstream scope 3 emission sources

Normal scope 3 emission sources

Optional scope 3 emission sources 
(indirect use-phase emissions)

Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included 
in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting 
company, including both upstream and downstream 
emissions (GHG Protocol, 2013). 

Upstream emissions are indirect GHG emissions related to 
purchased or acquired goods and services (GHG Protocol, 
2013).

Downstream emissions are indirect GHG emissions related 
to sold goods and services (GHG Protocol, 2013).

The GHG Protocol’s Scope 3 Standard identifies 15 
distinct reporting categories for scope 3 emission sources, 
and requires companies to quantify and report scope 3 
emissions from each category (GHG Protocol, 2013). 

Indirect use-phase emissions are described by the GHG 
Protocol Scope 3 Standard (GHG Protocol, 2013) as 
an optional reporting component. In contrast to direct 
use-phase emissions from products, such as the energy 
consumption of vehicles and appliances, indirect use-
phase emissions refer to the emissions that occur indirectly 
from the use of a product. For example, apparel requires 
washing and drying; soaps and detergents are often used 
with heated water.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) Sustainable aviation fuels are aviation fuels derived from 
renewables or waste considering certain sustainability 
criteria.

Transparency (rating) The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor assesses 
the transparency and integrity of companies’ climate 
pledges. Transparency ratings refer to the extent to which 
a company publicly discloses the information necessary 
to fully understand the integrity of that company’s 
approaches towards the various elements of corporate 
climate responsibility.

UN United Nations

UNFCCC United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

Unabated emissions Unabated emissions are GHG emissions from emission 
sources for which further emission reductions are 
technically feasible at that point in time. (See also 
residual emissions)

Value chain emissions A company’s full value chain emissions refers to the entirety 
of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions.

US United States

Value chain emissions A company’s full value chain emissions refers to the entirety 
of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions.

Selection criteria
We assess the top three global companies for each of the eight following sectors, according 
to their annual revenue in 2022 (Forbes, 2023): electric utilities; fashion; food and agriculture; 
automobile manufacturers. Our analysis excludes majority state-owned companies due to 
our perception that fundamental differences in management structures and decision-making 
structures for climate change strategy may significantly detract from the comparability of these 
companies’ plans, and the insights that we can draw from the company sample.

For food and agriculture – after including the largest company of the sector – we then include 
only companies with targets formulated under SBTi’s new FLAG guidance, to test the hypothesis 
that the new FLAG guidance can improve the integrity of agrifood companies’ targets.

For automobile manufacturers, we include also the largest 2 companies producing trucks only, 
to understand credibility of plans for heavy duty vehicles.

For this iteration of the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor, we did not require “membership 
of a Race to Zero initiative” as criteria for selection. For example, Daimler Trucks, Korea Electric 
and Stellantis do not have SBTi targets or other links to Race to Zero campaign. This counters 
the misguided critique that we attack the best leading companies.

The 20 companies covered by this monitor account for approximately USD 2.3 trillion of revenue 
in 2022, approximately 6% of revenue from the world’s largest 500 companies (Forbes, 2023). 
Their total self-reported GHG emission footprints in 2019, including scope 3 emissions, amount 
to approximately 3.9 GtCO2e. This is equivalent to roughly 7% of global GHG emissions.6

Section A also includes updates to the companies assessed in the 2022 and 2023 iterations 
of the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor, covering 51 companies in total. These 51 
companies account for approximately USD 6.1 trillion of revenue in 2022, approximately 16% 
of revenue from the world’s largest 500 companies (Forbes, 2023). Their total self-reported 
GHG emission footprints in 2019, including scope 3 emissions, amount to approximately 8.8 
GtCO2e. This is equivalent to roughly 15% of global GHG emissions.

6    Some overlap in emission statistics is likely in the cases that one company’s scope 3 emissions are included in the 
scope 1 or 2 emissions of another company in this analysis. We anticipate that any overlap is marginal and of 
limited significance to the key insights derived from this report. The companies’ combined emission footprint may 
also be higher than this estimate, due to some companies’ incomplete emission disclosure.

Annex II – Target integrity assessments
Adidas

Short-term targets towards 2030 Moderate Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Very poor

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Adidas’s 2025 climate neutrality target covers scope 1 and 2 emissions only and requires these emission sources to 
be reduced by 90% between 2017 and 2025. This is equivalent to the reduction of approximately 1% of Adidas’s 
total value chain emissions in 2019.

The target for a 30% reduction of value chain GHG emissions between 2017 and 2030 is more significant, covering 
all of the company’s disclosed value chain emissions. We estimate that the wtarget translates to approximately a 
reduction of 32-44% of the company’s full value chain emissions compared to average emissions levels in the period 
2017 to 2023. The upper end of the range is compared to average emissions in the time frame between 2017 and 
2023; the lower end of the range is compared to the same average but excluding years that appear as extreme outliers.

No targets identified. Adidas pledges carbon neutrality by 2050, but does not commit 
to a deep emissions reduction target alongside this pledge. The 
terminology of this target may be misleading; net-zero targets can 
give consumers and investors the impression that the company aims 
to reach deep levels of emission reductions, which the company does 
not commit to.

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Adidas’s 2030 target may be partially aligned with 1.5°C-compatible benchmarks, but the company has made 
limited very progress since 2017.

The meaning of the target is complicated by the fact that Adidas does not publish its emissions for the target base 
year in 2017 in public documentation, and that Adidas reports major fluctuations in its emissions in the period 
between 2017 and 2023, without providing explanations. Accordingly, a direct translation to 2019 emissions for 
comparison to benchmarks and other companies is not possible.

A 32-44% reduction below average 2017-2022 emission levels would be significant, and the upper end of that estimate 
would be aligned with global economy-wide benchmarks to keep warming below 1.5 °C (43% by 2030 compared to 
2019 levels(IPCC, 2022)). Given that emissions in the fashion industry occur in various sectors, including agriculture 
and energy, we expect the industry to decarbonise at the same speed as this global trajectory.

The upper end of our estimated 32-44% emission reduction range also meets sector benchmarks, though the lower 
range falls short of it: the textile and leather industry and the manufactured fibres and synthetic rubber industry 
should reduce their GHG emissions by 41% and 46%, respectively (2022, pp. 322; 327).  

While Adidas’s 2030 may be partially aligned with 1.5°C-compatible benchmarks, the company has made limited 
progress towards its target. In 2023, Adidas reported total emissions of 5.1 MtCO2e (excluding indirect use-phase 
emissions). This was the first year that the company reported emissions lower than the 2017 baseline of 5.8 MtCO2e.

Adidas’s lack of targets for the period 2031-2040 
neglects the need for interim targets to chart a 
trajectory towards the company’s long-term vision 
as recommended by the UN High Level Expert 
Group on Net Zero (UN HLEG, 2022).

We consider the lack of an explicit emission reduction target 
alongside the carbon neutrality pledge as highly insufficient 
considering the need for deep and credible emission reductions 
towards mid-century to stand a reasonable chance of limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2022) .

142Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



Daimler Truck

Short-term targets towards 2030 Unclear Medium-term targets for the 
period 2031-2040 Moderate Long-term targets for the period 

beyond 2040     Moderate

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Daimler Truck commits to the following emission targets towards 2030:

•	 Carbon neutrality for scope 1 and 2 emissions (production facilities) in Europe, India, Japan, 
and the US by 2025.

•	 42% reduction scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 below 2021. 

While not committing to any scope 3 emission reduction target towards 2030, Daimler Truck 
intends to sell “up to 60%” of zero-emission vehicles by 2030 in Europe Japan, and the US (Daimler 
Truck, 2023a, pp. 78, 81, 93). We interpret this as an aspirational upper bound to sell zero-emission 
vehicles (ZEVs) by 2030 while reserving Daimler Truck’s right to stay below it. The company does 
not set any minimum lower bound.

We cannot independently quantify Daimler Truck emissions reduction by 2030 along the entire 
value chain as the company does not publicly disclose scope 3 emissions.

Daimler Truck commits to carbon neutrality for scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 2039, but does not commit to a specific emissions 
reduction target for these scopes alongside this pledge. Instead, the 
company vaguely states its intention  to use “renewable energies 
and CO2 compensation certificates” to meet the target (Daimler 
Truck, 2023a, p. 93).

The company does not commit to any scope 3 emission reduction 
targets towards 2040 but intends to offer 100% of zero-emission 
vehicles by 2039 in Europe, Japan, and the US (Daimler Truck, 
2023a, pp. 81, 93). For these three geographies, the company 
aims for carbon neutral products and services in its supply chain 
by 2039 (Daimler Truck, 2023a, pp. 81, 93).

We cannot independently quantify Daimler Truck emissions 
reduction by 2040 along the entire value chain as the company 
does not publicly disclose scope 3 emissions.

Daimler Truck aims to achieve carbon neutrality across the entire value 
chain by 2050, but does not commit to a specific emissions reduction 
target alongside this pledge. Since the company’s carbon neutrality 
pledge does not entail any explicit commitment to deep decarbonisation, 
labelling it as a ‘carbon neutrality target’ may be misleading. 

Daimler Truck also aims to sell only zero-emission vehicles worldwide 
by 2050, with a target already set to achieve this in Europe, the United 
States and Japan by 2039 already (Daimler Truck, 2023a, pp. 78, 81).

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

We cannot independently assess Daimler Truck’s aspirational and non-committal intention to 
sell zero-emission vehicles by 2030 against existing 1.5°C-aligned milestones. Recent literature 
suggests that 30–37% of heavy-duty trucks should be battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell 
electric vehicles (FCEVs) globally by 2030 to align with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement targets (UNFCCC, 
2021, pp. 10–11; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). Daimler Truck merely 
outlines its intention to sell “up to 60%” of zero-emission vehicles by 2030 in Europe, Japan, and 
the United States (Daimler Truck, 2023a, pp. 78, 81, 93). These key markets jointly represent around 
75% of its total revenue in 2022. We interpret this as an aspirational upper bound for the sales 
of ZEVs, allowing Daimler Truck leeway to sell fewer vehicles if necessary. In addition, we cannot 
find any targets for the sale of zero-emission vehicles by 2030 in other markets, which collectively 
accounted for 25% of total revenue in 2022. Furthermore, there is no emission reduction target 
for its upstream scope 3 emissions.

Daimler Truck’s 2039 interim targets partially meet 1.5°C Paris 
Agreement-aligned milestones for heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers’ 
downstream scope 3 emissions, as identified in existing literature 
(UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Mission Possible Partnership, 2022, 
p. 40; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93).  

Daimler Truck aims to offer 100% of zero-emission vehicles by 2039 in 
Europe, Japan, and the United States (Daimler Truck, 2023a, pp. 81, 93), 
jointly representing around 75% of its total revenue as key markets in 
2022. This is in line with the 1.5°C-compatible shares of 100% battery 
electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) by 2040 
in advanced economies and China (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Boehm 
et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88–93). However, we could not 
identify any targets for the sale of zero-emission vehicles towards 2040 
in other markets outside Europe, Japan, and the US, which collectively 
accounted for 25% of total revenue in 2022. Additionally, we could 
not identify specific targets for its scope 1, 2, and upstream scope 3 
emissions alongside the two scope-specific carbon neutrality pledges.

Daimler Truck’s global target to sell 100% zero-emission vehicles 
by 2050 meets the 1.5°C-aligned milestones identified in existing 
literature (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Mission Possible Partnership, 
2022, p. 40; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). 
This global phase-out date for ICEs in heavy-duty vehicles is in line with 
upper range of decarbonisation milestones identified in the literature, 
which suggests reaching a 100% share of battery electric vehicles 
(BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) between 2045–2050 
globally (Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93).

By 2030, compared to 2020 levels:

•	 Reduce scope 1 (excluding FLAG emissions) and 2 emissions by 47.2% 

•	 Reduce scope 1 and 3 FLAG emissions by 30.3%

•	 Reduce scope 3 non-FLAG emissions by 42.0%

•	 Reduce methane emissions from fresh milk by 30%

Danone’s short-term targets translate to an emission reduction of 30% compared to 2019 value chain 
emissions. The share of emissions not covered equals roughly 6 MtCO2e in 2030, when comparing 
the baseline emissions presented in the Climate Transition Plan to emissions disclosed under CDP. 

We could not include Danone’s methane target in this estimate. Danone does not provide baseline 
emissions for methane specifically, and it is unclear whether this target is contained within – or 
additional to – other scope 1 and 3 targets.

No targets identified for the 2031-2040 period. Danone does not commit to a deep emissions reduction target alongside its 2050 
net-zero pledge. However, the company’s estimated residual emissions in 2050 
would imply an emission reduction of roughly 63% compared to 2019 value chain 
emissions. Since these estimated reductions under the net-zero pledge fall short 
of a commitment to deep emission reductions (i.e., at least 90% below 2019 levels 
globally, or 72% for the agriculture sector), we consider that the terminology of the 
net-zero target may be potentially misleading. Moreover, the company’s net-zero 
pledge does not entail an explicit commitment to this level of emission reductions.

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Danone’s range of short-term targets almost meets 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for 
the food and agriculture sector identified in existing literature for the emission sources that they 
cover, although some emission sources are not covered by the targets. Teske (2022, p. 328) describes 
that between 2019 and 2030, the food and agriculture industry should reduce its scope 3 emissions 
by 34%. Overall, the company’s 2030 targets – including emission sources that are not covered by the 
target – are almost aligned with this benchmark.

Boehm et al. (2023) describe emission reduction requirements of 17% for enteric fermentation and 
21% for manure management, both below 2017 levels. Danone’s implied emission reduction targets 
go beyond these levels.

The SBTi published its guidance for Forest, Land, and Agriculture (FLAG) in 2022. Although the FLAG 
guidance requires companies to commit to annual reductions of at least 3.03%, translating to reductions 
of 30.3% between 2020 and 2030 (SBTi, 2022b, pp. 44–45),  this includes land sequestration carbon 
dioxide removals. We cannot use the FLAG guidance for this assessment due to the lack of specificity on 
the role of emission reductions vis-à-vis land sequestration CDR, towards aligning with 1.5°C-compatible 
transition pathways for the sector.

Danone’s lack of targets for the period 2031-2040 
neglects the need for interim targets to chart a 
trajectory towards the company’s long-term vision 
as recommended by the UN High Level Expert 
Group on Net Zero (UN HLEG, 2022).

We find that Danone’s 2050 target meets 1.5°C Paris Agreement aligned milestones 
for food and agriculture sector. Teske (2022, p. 328) identifies 1.5°C-aligned 
absolute emission reduction milestones for various emission sources of agricultural 
activities, which represent upstream scope 3 emissions for Danone. All energy-
related emissions need to reduce 100% by 2050, whereas AFOLU emissions and 
non-CO2 emissions need to reduce by 42% by 2050 below 2019 levels. In sum, 
these required reductions mean a reduction of 51% across all scopes, below 2019 
levels. Danone’s implied emission reduction commitment aligns with this.

The Transition Pathways Initiative (TPI) derives an emission intensity per tonne 
of agricultural input aligned with ‘1.5°Ctrajectories by 2050: 0.414 tCO2/tonne 
agricultural input (Dietz et al., 2022, p. 13). This represents an 85% reduction in 
intensity compared to 2.751 tCO2/tonne agricultural input in the 2020 base year. 
Due to a lack of information on intensity and volumes of agricultural input, we cannot 
directly assess whether Danone’s implied emission reduction commitment meets 
these intensity benchmarks. However, the implied emission reduction commitment 
and plan to increase the share of plant-based protein in production contribute to 
the shift that is signalled by the required change in intensities. 

Boehm et al. (2023) describe emission reduction requirements of 29% for enteric 
fermentation and 39% for manure management, both below 2017 levels. Danone’s 
implied emission reduction commitment goes beyond these levels.

We evaluate Danone’s implied emission reduction commitment moderate rather 
than high or reasonable because Danone does not commit to the implied reductions 
that we derive from the company’s estimated residual emissions. The company only 
provides an estimate of residual emissions; we do not consider this to represent an 
explicit emission reduction commitment.

 Duke Energy

Short-term targets towards 2030 Very Poor Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Poor Long-term targets for the 

period beyond 2040     Very poor

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Duke Energy commits to the following emission reduction targets towards 2030 (Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 65):

•	 Reduction of scope 1 carbon emissions from electricity generation by at least 50% below 2005 levels 

•	 Net-zero methane emissions from its fossil gas distribution business

The company’s scope 1 target translates to a reduction of 14% across the value chain below 2019 levels by 
2030. Duke Energy anticipates that its target intensity from scope 1 emissions will be about 225 gCO2e/kWh 
by 2030 (Duke Energy, 2022, p. 58).

Alongside these emission reduction targets, Duke Energy plans to expand its renewable energy portfolio to 
constitute 20% of its total generation capacity by 2030, and to reduce the share of coal in its total generation 
to below 5% by 2030, pending regulatory approval.

Duke Energy set the following targets towards 2040 (Duke 
Energy, 2023a, p. 65,67):

•	 Reduction of carbon scope 1 emissions from electricity 
generation by 80% below 2005 levels by 2040

•	 Reduction of scope 2 and some scope 3 emissions 
(fossil fuel procurement, power purchased for resale, 
and downstream use of gas) by 50% below 2021 levels 
by 2035.

These commitments translate to a reduction of 39% across 
the value chain below 2019 levels by 2040. 

Duke Energy aims to reach 35,000 MW of renewable energy 
capacity by 2035 and anticipates renewable generation 
share of 35% by 2040. Duke Energy aims to exit from coal 
generation by 2035, pending regulatory approval (Duke 
Energy, 2023a, p. 65).

Duke Energy has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions 
by 2050 (Duke Energy, 2023a, p. 65). Since Duke Energy’s 
net-zero pledge does not include a specific emission reduction 
commitment, we consider that the terminology of this target may 
be misleading. ‘Net zero’ terminology can give the impression that 
Duke Energy aims to reach deep levels of emission reductions, 
which the company does not commit to.

Duke Energy aims to reach 40% renewable generation and 
to phase out fossil gas in generation by 2050 (Duke Energy, 
2023a, p. 20,48,49).

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Duke Energy’s short-term targets do not meet 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for electric utilities 
based on available literature. The IEA Net Zero Report highlights that the energy sector needs to reduce emissions 
by 44% by 2030 relative to 2021 levels to align with a 1.5°C pathway (IEA, 2023c). Duke Energy's emissions 
reduction target translates to an 8% reduction within that period, falling far below the sector benchmark. 

Duke Energy’s projected carbon intensity of approximately 225 gCO2e/kWh by 2030 does not align with sectoral 
benchmarks. Boehm et al. (2023, p. 29) and CAT (2023b, p. 20) find that carbon intensity should decrease to 
25-26 gCO2e/kWh in the United States by 2030; Teske et al. (Teske et al., 2023) proposes a maximum of 64 
gCO2/kWh in OECD countries. TPI’s benchmark of 138 gCO2e/kWh is taken from the IEA’s 2021 Net Zero by 
2050 report, but the IEA (2023) has since revised this benchmark to 186 gCO2e/kWh (Dietz, Gardiner, et al., 
2021; IEA, 2023c). The IEA foresees higher levels of CCS and BECCS than CAT and the State of Climate Action 
report (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29). 

Duke Energy's target for 20% renewable energy by 2030 falls far below the 68%-86% benchmark for the United 
States (CAT, 2023b, p. 16). 

Duke Energy’s medium-term targets do not meet 1.5°C 
Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for electric utilities 
based on available literature. Developed countries need 
to reach net-zero emissions by 2035 to stay within a 
1.5°C-compatible pathway (equivalent to 0 gCO2e/kWh) 
(IEA, 2023c). The company's projected carbon intensity for 
energy production is estimated to be around 45 gCO2e/kWh 
by 2040. This is partly due to the company’s plan to retire 
certain coal fleets only by 2035, missing the more stringent 
phase-out recommendation for advanced economies by 
2030 as suggested by the IEA. Duke Energy anticipates that 
natural gas will account for 27% of its generation mix by 
2040, despite recent literature suggesting the need for the 
full phase-out of unabated fossil gas in the United States by 
2040 (CAT, 2023b, p. 12). Duke Energy’s renewable energy 
target of 35% in its generation mix by 2040 falls significantly 
short of 1.5°C-aligned benchmarks, which recommend 
85%–95% renewables by 2035 and 93%–97% renewables 
by 2040 in the United States (CAT, 2023b, p. 16). 

Duke Energy’s long-term net-zero by 2050 target does not meet 
a 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for electric utilities. 
Duke Energy’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 
2050 does not meet the urgent timelines required for electric 
utilities in advanced economies, which need to reach net zero 
by 2035 (IEA, 2023c). The company's plan to phase out fossil 
gas only by 2050 indicates a slow transition pace away from 
fossil-fuel-based electricity generation and poses the risk of a 
fossil gas lock-in and stranded assets. Duke Energy’s renewable 
energy target of 40% in its generation mix by 2050 also falls 
significantly short of the global 1.5°C-aligned benchmarks, 
which recommend a range of 99%-100% renewable energy by 
2050 (CAT, 2023b, p. 16).

Enel

Short-term targets towards 2030 Moderate Medium-term targets for the period 2031-2040 Reasonnable

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Enel commits to the following emission reduction targets towards 2030, compared to 2017, which translate to a 
reduction of 59% across the value chain by 2030. 
•	 68% reduction in all absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions.

•	 80% reduction in carbon intensity relating to power generation, resulting in a carbon intensity of 72 gCO2e/
kWh (covering 98% of scope 1 emissions.)

•	 78% reduction in carbon intensity relating to integrated power, resulting in a carbon intensity of 73 gCO2e/
kWh (covering 98% of scope 1 emissions and 73% of scope 3 emissions, category 3.)

•	 55% reduction in absolute emissions relating to gas retail (covering 100% of scope 3 emissions, category 11)

•	 55% reduction in “additional absolute GHG emissions” (covering 0.4% of scope 1 emissions, 100% of scope 
2 emissions, 28.6% of scope 3 emissions, category 1 for the 2030 target, and 40% for the 2040 target, and 
26.6% of scope 3 emissions, category 3.

Enel also commits to phasing-out coal in electricity generation by 2027, and achieving an 85% share of renewables 
in total installed capacity by 2030.

Enel has pledged to achieve net-zero zero emissions by 2040, including at least 98% emission reductions, compared to 2017:

•	 99% reduction in all absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions.

•	 100% reduction in carbon intensity relating to power generation (covering 98% of scope 1 emissions).

•	 100% reduction in carbon intensity relating to integrated power (covering 98% of scope 1 emissions and 73% of scope 
3 emissions, category 3).

•	 100% reduction in absolute emissions relating to gas retail (covering 100% of scope 3 emissions, category 11).

•	 90% reduction in additional absolute GHG emissions, resulting in residual emissions of 2.5 Mt CO2e (covering 0.4% of 
scope 1 emissions, 100% of scope 2 emissions, 28.6% of scope 3 emissions, category 1 for the 2030 target and 40% 
for the 2040 target, and 26.6% of scope 3 emissions, category 3).

Enel also commits to phase-out gas in electricity generation and exit from retail gas sales by 2040, and to achieving a100% 
share of renewables in total installed capacities by 2040.

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Enel’s 2030 targets partially meet the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for electric utilities, as identified 
in existing literature. Boehm et al. (2023, p. 29) and CAT (2023b, p. 20) suggest that global carbon intensity should 
decrease to 48-80 gCO2e/kWh by 2030, and to 6-12 gCO2e/kWh in the EU (CAT, 2023b, p. 19); Teske et al. (Teske et 
al., 2023) propose 132 gCO2/kWh globally and 80 gCO2/kWh in the EU. The benchmark by the Transition Performance 
Initiative of 138 gCO2e/kWh is taken from the IEA’s 2021 Net Zero by 2050 report, but the IEA has since revised 
this benchmark to 186 gCO2e/kWh (Dietz, Gardiner, et al., 2021; IEA, 2023c). The IEA allows for higher levels of 
CCS and BECCS than CAT and the State of Climate Action report (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29). 

Enel’s intensity targets fall within the lower end of this range, with 72g CO2e/kWh for power generation (scope 1) 
and 73g CO2e/kWh for integrated power. However, these targets are significantly higher than the benchmarks set 
for the EU, where Enel generated 83% of its revenues in 2022 (Enel, 2023a, p. 460).

Enel’s emission reduction target of 59% by 2030 below 2019 levels (own calculations) is in line with the 1.5°C-compatible 
pathway for the energy sector suggested by the IEA (IEA, 2023c). The recommends a 44% absolute emissions reduction 
globally by 2030, compared to 2021.  However, in the EU, the power sector needs to achieve even steeper emission 
reductions and reach net zero by 2035 (IEA, 2023c). Enel’s target of 85% of renewable capacity in its energy mix 
by 2030 surpasses global benchmarks, which recommend a share of 68% renewable energy in installed capacities 
by 2030 (IEA, 2023c).

Enel’s 2040 medium-term targets partly meet the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for electric utilities, as 
identified in existing literature. Enel aims to achieve zero carbon intensity for electricity generation (including its own 
generation and purchased electricity) by 2040 and to exit from gas by the same year. These goals are in line with the 
1.5°C-compatible pathway suggested in the IEA Net Zero Report, which requires the energy sector to reach a CO2 intensity 
of electricity generation of 3g CO2e/kWh in 2040 (IEA, 2023b, p199). However, Enel’s headline target of achieving net-zero 
emissions by 2040 falls short of the urgent timelines required for electric utilities in advanced economies, which should 
aim for net zero by 2035 (IEA, 2023c). On the other hand, Enel’s target of 100% of renewable capacity in its energy mix by 
2040 surpasses the 1.5°C-compatible global benchmarks, which recommends a share of 80% renewable energy in installed 
capacities (IEA, 2023c).

ENGIE

Short-term targets towards 2030 Very poor Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Very poor

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

ENGIE commits to the following targets towards 2030, compared to 2022 (own calculations):

• 40% reduction in absolute GHG emissions from energy production (scopes 1 and 3).

• 26% reduction in absolute GHG emissions from final gas sales (scope 3).

• 42% reduction in carbon intensity for energy production (scope 1) and energy consumption (scope 2), 
resulting in a carbon intensity of 110gCO2e/kWh

• 44% reduction in carbon intensity for energy sales produced (scopes 1 and 3) and purchased (scope 3), 
resulting in a carbon intensity of 152 gCO2e/kWh

• 6% reduction in absolute “other GHG emissions, including scope 3 from procurement, capital goods, and the 
upstream of purchased fuels and electricity (scope 3 categories 1, 2 and 3)”.

ENGIE also commits a coal-phase out by 2027 for own electricity generation, and a 58% share of renewables 
capacity in its electricity mix by 2030.

ENGIE’s absolute targets of 43 MtCO2e from energy production and 52 MtCO2e from final gas sales amount to a 
reduction of at least 24% below 2019 levels across full value chain emissions by 2030 (based on own calculations). 
The company’s different targets span different scopes, with coverage sometimes not specified, making it impossible 
to aggregate them into one single absolute target for 2030.

No target identified. ENGIE aims to reach net zero by 2045. Their commitment is “net 
zero carbon” but we understand this to cover all GHG emissions, 
because Enel accompanies the target by a commitment to reduce 
GHG by 90%. This translates to a reduction of 86% by 2045 below 
2019 levels across the entire value chain alongside its net-zero pledge. 
Since this reduction target falls short of a commitment to deep 
emission reductions (i.e., at least 90% below 2019 levels), we consider 
that the “net zero” terminology may be misleading. This position is 
in line with the ISO Guidelines for Net Zero and the SBTi Net Zero 
Standard (ISO, 2022; SBTi, 2023b). 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

ENGIE’s 2030 targets do not meet the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for electric utilities, as identified 
in existing literature. Boehm et al. (2023, p. 29) and CAT (2023b, p. 20) suggest that global carbon intensity should 
decrease to 48-80 gCO2e/kWh by 2030, and to 6-12 gCO2e/kWh in the EU (CAT, 2023b, p. 19); Teske et al. (Teske et 
al., 2023) propose 132 gCO2/kWh globally and 80 gCO2/kWh in the EU. The benchmark by the Transition Performance 
Initiative of 138 gCO2e/kWh is taken from the IEA’s 2021 Net Zero by 2050 report, but the IEA has since revised 
this benchmark to 186 gCO2e/kWh (Dietz, Gardiner, et al., 2021; IEA, 2023c). The IEA allows for higher levels of 
CCS and BECCS than CAT and the State of Climate Action report (Boehm et al., 2023, p. 29).

ENGIE’s intensity targets fall within the upper part of the benchmark range: 110 gCO2e/kWh for energy production 
(scope 1) and energy consumption (scope 2) and 153 gCO2e/kWh for energy sales produced (scopes 1 and 3) and 
purchased (scope 3). However, they significantly surpass the benchmarks for the EU, where ENGIE has 40% of its 
installed capacities (ENGIE, 2023, p. 3). 

According to the IEA Net Zero Report, aligning the energy sector with a 1.5°C-compatible pathway requires a 44% 
emissions reduction globally by 2030 compared to 2021 (IEA, 2023c). In Europe, the power sector needs to achieve 
even steeper emission reductions and reach net zero by 2035 (IEA, 2023c). ENGIE’s targets fall significantly short 
of this benchmark. Engie’s target of 58% of renewable capacity also falls short of the global benchmark for a 68% 
renewable energy capacity share by 2030 (IEA, 2023c).

ENGIE’s absence of targets for the period towards 
2040 neglects the need for interim targets to chart 
a trajectory towards the company’s long-term 
vision, as recommended by the UN High Level 
Expert Group on Net Zero (UN HLEG, 2022).

ENGIE’s 2045 target does not meet 1.5°C Paris Agreement aligned 
milestones for electric utilities identified in existing literature. The 
emissions reduction target of 86% below 2019 levels means that the 
company plans to still emit up to 26 MtCO2e GHG emissions in 2045, 
although alternatives to achieve zero emissions in the electric utilities 
sector already exist. The IEA and CAT emphasise that staying within a 
1.5°C-compatible pathway will require electric utilities in developed 
countries like the EU to reach net zero (equivalent to 0 gCO2e/kWh) 
by 2035, ten years earlier than 2045 (CAT, 2023b; IEA, 2023c).

Fast Retailing

Short-term targets towards 2030 Very poor Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Very poor

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

For 2030, Fast retailing commits to:

•	 Reduce absolute emissions from its own operations (such as stores and main offices) by 90% below 2019 
levels.

•	 Reduce absolute emissions from raw materials, fabric, and garment production for the Uniqlo and GU brands 
by 20% by 2030 below 2019 levels.

These targets equate to a commitment to reduce all value chain emissions footprint by 19% by 2030, compared 
to 2019 levels.

No targets identified. Fast Retailing pledges to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, but does 
not commit to a deep emissions reduction target alongside this 
pledge. The terminology of this target may be misleading; net-zero 
targets can give consumers and investors the impression that the 
company aims to reach deep levels of emission reductions, which 
the company does not commit to.

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?
These targets do not meet cross-sectoral and sector-specific 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones identified 
in existing literature. According to the IPCC’s global economy-wide benchmarks to keep warming below 1.5°C, 
GHG emissions should reduce by 43% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels (IPCC, 2022). Given that emissions in the 
fashion industry occur in various sectors, including agriculture and energy, we expect the industry to decarbonise 
at the same speed as this global trajectory. Fast Retailing’s targets fall short of this global benchmark.

The targets also miss sectoral benchmarks. Teske (2022, pp. 322; 327) considers that between 2019 and 2030, 
the textile and leather industry and the manufactured fibres and synthetic rubber industry should reduce their 
GHG emissions by 41% and 46%, respectively. To be in line with these sectoral benchmarks, Fast Retailing’s target 
for upstream scope 3 emissions should be set at a level of at least 41%. However, its target for upstream scope 3 
emissions represents a 16% reduction below 2019. 

Assuming that emissions are reduced linearly in the 2019–2030 period, Fast Retailing is currently committed to 
annual emission reductions of 8.2% for scopes 1 and 2 and 1.3% for scope 3, by 2030. The SBTi guidance requires 
companies in the apparel industry to commit to annual reductions in their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions of at least 
2.5% to comply with the ‘well below 2°C’ benchmark and 4.2% to comply with the SBTi’s 1.5°C benchmark (SBTi, 
2018, pp. 22; 27). While Fast Retailing’s reduction target for scope 1 and 2 emissions is likely aligned with the SBTi’s 
1.5°C, its target for scope 3 does not even meet the ‘well below 2°C’ benchmark.

Fast Retailing’s lack of targets for the period 2031-
2040 neglects the need for interim targets to chart 
a trajectory towards the company’s long-term 
vision as recommended by the UN High Level 
Expert Group on Net Zero (UN HLEG, 2022).

We consider the lack of an explicit emission reduction target 
alongside the net zero pledge as highly insufficient considering 
the need for deep and credible emission reductions towards mid-
century to stand a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to 
1.5°C (IPCC, 2022).

H&M Group commits to reducing emissions across the entire value chain by 56% by 2030, compared 
to 2019 levels.

H&M Group commits to an emissions reduction target of 90% by 2040 
below 2019 levels across the entire value chain alongside its net-zero

H&M Group does not commit to any emission reduction 
target beyond 2040, but has already committed to deep 
decarbonisation in the medium term towards 2040.

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

H&M Group’s 2030 emission reduction target meets global and sectoral 1.5°C-aligned benchmarks. 
Given that emissions in the fashion industry occur in various sectors, including agriculture and energy, 
we consider this target aligned with global benchmarks that require GHG and CO2 emissions to reduce 
by 43% and 48% by 2030 respectively (IPCC, 2022).

Teske (2022) considers that between 2019 and 2030, the textile and leather industry and the 
manufactured fibres and synthetic rubber industry should reduce their GHG emissions in absolute 
terms by 41% and 46%, respectively. This covers all emissions associated with producing fabrics and 
other materials and manufacturing the clothes. To be in line with these sectoral benchmarks, H&M 
Group’s target for upstream scope 3 emissions should be set at a level of at least 41%. The company’s 
target goes beyond this reduction level.

We evaluate H&M Group’s 2030 target as ‘reasonable’ rather than ‘high’ integrity because of the lack 
of a corresponding short-term target within a five-year timeframe to substantiate it. Setting short-term 
interim targets in a similar format as its 2030 targets requiring immediate action and accountability 
are of primary importance for credible corporate commitments to fight climate change (ISO, 2022; 
UN HLEG, 2022).

H&M Group’s 2040 emission reduction target meets global and sectoral 
1.5°C-aligned benchmarks. Given that emissions in the fashion industry 
occur in various sectors, including agriculture and energy, we consider 
this target aligned with global benchmarks. According to the IPCC’s global 
economy-wide benchmarks to keep warming below 1.5°C, GHG emissions 
should reduce by 80% by 2040, compared to 2019 levels (IPCC, 2022). 
The target also meets benchmarks for fashion retailers’ upstream scope 3 
emissions. According to Teske (2022), emissions in the manufactured fibres 
and synthetic rubber industry need to reduce by 76% and emissions in 
the textile and leather sector by 74% by 2040, below 2019 levels. These 
emissions form part of H&M Group’s upstream scope 3 emissions.

We evaluate H&M Group’s 2040 target as ‘reasonable’ integrity rather 
than ‘high’ because of the lack of interim targets on five-year intervals, 
as per the recommendations of the UN High Level Expert Group on Net 
Zero (ISO, 2022; UN HLEG, 2022).

Iberdrola

Short-term targets towards 2030 Reasonable Medium-term targets for the period 2031-2040 Moderate

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Iberdrola has pledged to reach carbon neutrality in scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030. Furthermore, it commits to reducing 
absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 65% by 2030 compared to a 2020 base year with the following breakdown 
(Iberdrola, 2023a):

•	 A reduction of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from power generation by 83% per kWh

•	 A reduction of scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related activities, covering all sold electricity, by 
85% per kWh.

•	 A reduction of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of sold products by 42%

•	 A reduction of all remaining absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 46%

To substantiate its short- and medium-term targets, Iberdrola also estimates a path to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 
GHG emissions by 20% by 2026 from a 2020 base year (Iberdrola, 2023g).

These targets translate to a reduction of 64% across the value chain below 2019 levels by 2030 and a reduction of 61% 
across the value chain below 2021 levels by 2030. Since the company’s short-term pledge does not entail any commitment 
to deep decarbonisation (i.e., reduction of at least 90% of 2019 emissions across the entire value chain), we consider that 
the ‘carbon neutrality’ terminology of its short-term target may be misleading. Using ‘carbon neutrality’ terminology can 
give consumers and investors the impression that Iberdrola aims to reach deep levels of emission reductions, which the 
company does not commit to.

Iberdrola has pledged to achieve net zero across all scopes before 2040. This commitment translates to a reduction in 
scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% by 2039 from a 2020 base year with the following breakdown (Iberdrola, 2023a):

•	 A reduction of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from power generation by 84% per kWh 

•	 A reduction of scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy related activities, covering all sold electricity, 
by 95% per kWh 

•	 A reduction of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of sold products by 90% 

•	 A reduction of all remaining absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 90%

Iberdrola commits to an emissions reduction target of at least 90% by 2040 below 2019 levels across the entire value 
chain alongside its net-zero pledge. 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Iberdrola’s short-term emissions reduction commitments are in line with a 1.5°C trajectory for the electric utilities, based 
on available literature. The IEA Net Zero by 2050 Report highlights that the energy sector needs to reduce emissions by 
44% by 2030 relative to 2021 levels to align with a 1.5°C pathway (IEA, 2023c). Iberdrola’s emissions reduction target of 
61% from 2021 to 2030 (own calculations) exceeds this industry benchmark. 

Iberdrola has already closed its last coal plants in 2020, significantly ahead of the 2030 deadline for phasing out unabated 
coal in advanced economies (CAT, 2023b; IEA, 2023c). In 2030, Iberdrola’s own renewable energy installed capacity will 
account for 93% of its total installed capacity, which outperforms the global benchmarks of 68-77% of renewable energy 
installed capacity by 2030 (IEA, 2023c; IRENA, 2023c). The company’s focus on renewables is expected to contribute to 
a significant reduction in Iberdrola’s carbon intensity for energy production (scope 1). By 2030, its emission intensity is 
expected to fall below 10 gCO2e/kWh, marking a 90% decrease from 2019 levels (Iberdrola, 2023c, 2023f, p. 64). This 
figure is notably lower than the recommended carbon intensity range of 48-186 gCO2e/kWh by 2030 to stay below the 
1.5°C threshold as suggested by existing literature (Dietz, Gardiner, et al., 2021; Boehm et al., 2023; CAT, 2023c, 2023b; IEA, 
2023c; Jaeger et al., 2023; Teske et al., 2023). Iberdrola’s carbon intensity target in 2030 also falls within the recommended 
carbon intensity range of 6-12 gCO2e/kWh in the EU27 region by 2030 to align with a 1.5°C pathway (CAT, 2023b, p. 20).

Iberdrola’s 2040 medium-term targets partially meet the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for electric 
utilities, based on available literature. Iberdrola’s 2040 net-zero target falls short of the more urgent timelines 
recommended for electric utilities in advanced economies, which are advised to aim for net zero by 2035 (IEA, 2023c). 
While the IEA suggests that the global energy sector should reach net zero by 2045, advanced economies should 
reach this milestone a decade earlier (IEA, 2023c). Given that Iberdrola operates mainly in the European Union, United 
Kingdom and United States, the company should bring its net-zero target forward to 2035 to meet these regional 
benchmarks. Moreover, Iberdrola has yet to announce a strategy for the phase-out of its fossil gas-fired power plant 
portfolio or for ending its fossil gas sales. To align with a 1.5°C pathway, Iberdrola should phase out unabated fossil 
gas by 2035 in developed countries (CAT, 2023b; IEA, 2023c), and by 2040 in developing countries (CAT, 2023b, p. 
1). Additionally, Iberdrola’s 2040 target is assessed as having ‘moderate’ integrity rather than ‘reasonable,’ due to the 
lack of a corresponding target within a five-year timeframe to substantiate it.

Inditex

Short-term targets towards 2030 Reasonable Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Reasonable Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     N/A

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Inditex has set out two interim GHG emissions targets: 

•	 Reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90% below 2018 levels by 2030.

•	 Reduce scope 3 emissions by 50% below 2018 levels by 2030.

The targets jointly represent a reduction of 46% by 2030 across the entire value chain below 
2019 levels. To estimate the implied reduction in Inditex’s targets, we consider their whole value 
chain emissions, which we calculate by using the larger scope 2 estimate. For Inditex, this is the 
location-based estimate. As Inditex’s targets clearly state that they only apply to market-based scope 
2 emissions, we first calculate the scope 2 emission reduction based on the market-based estimate 
and then tally up that reduction against Inditex’s full value chain emissions. 

Inditex’s headline pledge includes a commitment to reach net-zero 
GHG emissions by 2040. Alongside its headline pledge, Inditex 
commits to reducing its full value chain emissions (scope 1, 2, and 
3) by 90% below 2018 levels.

This target represents a reduction of 89% below 2019 levels by 
2040. Since the net zero pledge entails a commitment to deep 
decarbonisation across the entire value chain, we consider that 
the net zero terminology is unlikely to be misleading. Net zero 
targets can give consumers and investors the impression that the 
company aims to reach deep levels of emission reductions, which 
the company has committed itself to do.

Inditex does not commit to any emission reduction target beyond 
2040, but has already committed to deep decarbonisation in the 
medium term towards 2040.

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Inditex’s commitment for emission reductions across the value chain meet 1.5°C-aligned milestones 
identified in existing literature. According to the IPCC’s global economy-wide benchmarks to keep 
warming below 1.5°C, GHG emissions should reduce by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019  (IPCC, 
2022). Given that emissions in the fashion industry occur in various sectors, including agriculture 
and energy, we expect the industry to decarbonise at the same speed as this global trajectory. 
Inditex’s targets currently meet this global benchmark.

The company’s scope 3 2030 target is also aligned with other 1.5°C-compatible sectoral benchmarks. 
Teske (2022) considers that between 2019 and 2030, the textile and leather industry and the 
manufactured fibres and synthetic rubber industry should reduce their GHG emissions by 41% and 
46%, respectively. This covers all emissions associated with producing fabrics and other materials 
and manufacturing the clothes. To be in line with these sectoral benchmarks, Inditex’s target for 
upstream scope 3 emissions should be set at a level of at least 41%. Inditex’s scope 3 target implies 
a reduction of 48% below 2019 levels when considering only scope 3 emissions.

Inditex’s reduction commitment across the value chain meets 
1.5°C-aligned milestones as identified in existing literature. 
According to the IPCC’s global economy-wide benchmarks to 
keep warming below 1.5°C, GHG emissions should reduce by 80% 
by 2040, compared to 2019  (IPCC, 2022). Given that emissions in 
the fashion industry occur in various sectors, including agriculture 
and energy, we expect the industry to decarbonise at the same 
speed as this global trajectory. Inditex’s targets currently meet 
this global benchmark.

The company’s 2040 target is also aligned with other 
1.5°C-compatible sectoral benchmarks. Teske (2022) considers 
that between 2019 and 2040, the textile and leather industry and 
the manufactured fibres and synthetic rubber industry should 
reduce their scope 1 GHG emissions by 71-74%, scope 2 by 92%, 
and scope 3 by 44%. Inditex’s implied target of reducing their 
whole value chain emissions by 89% below 2019 levels clearly 
meets these benchmarks.

KEPCO

Short-term targets towards 2030 Very poor Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Very poor

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

KEPCO commits to reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 47.4% by 2030, using 2018 as the baseline (KEPCO, 
2023, p. 31). Alongside this, the company aims for renewables to account for 21.5% of its total generation capacity 
by 2030 (KEPCO, 2022, p. 70).

KEPCO’s commitment to reducing emissions for scope 1 and 2 translates to a reduction of 18% across the value 
chain by 2030 compared to its 2019 baseline, or 22% below 2021 levels (own calculations). 

No target identified. KEPCO has pledged to reach carbon neutrality for its own operations 
(i.e. scopes 1 and 2) by 2050, but does not present a specific emissions 
reduction commitment alongside this pledge. 

Since the company’s pledge does not entail any commitment to deep 
decarbonisation, we consider that the ‘carbon neutrality’ terminology 
of this target may be misleading. 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

KEPCO’s short-term emissions reduction commitments do not align with the 1.5°C trajectory for the electric 
utilities sector, based on available literature. According to the IEA Net Zero by 2050 Report, aligning the energy 
sector with a 1.5°C-compatible pathway requires a 44% emissions reduction globally in 2030 compared to 2021 
(IEA, 2023c). In South Korea, an advanced economy, the power sector needs to realise steeper emission reductions 
and reach net zero by 2035 (IEA, 2023c). KEPCO’s commitment to a reduction of 22% between 2021 and 2030 
(own calculations) falls well below the sector benchmark and would postpone necessary reductions beyond 2030. 
KEPCO’s target of achieving a 21.5% share of renewable generation in its energy mix also falls short of global 
benchmarks (KEPCO, 2022, p. 70), which recommend a range of 59-89% renewables share in total generation by 
2030 (Boehm et al., 2023; CAT, 2023b; IEA, 2023c; IRENA, 2023c).

Due to limited data disclosed by KEPCO, we were unable to assess the company’s carbon intensity and its alignment 
with a 1.5°C pathway. 

KEPCO’s lack of medium-term targets towards 
2040 neglects the need for interim targets to chart 
a trajectory towards the company’s long-term 
vision as recommended by the UN High Level 
Expert Group on Net Zero (UN HLEG, 2022, p. 15).

KEPCO’s long-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 does 
not meet the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for electric 
utilities. While we are unable to calculate the actual reductions across 
the full value chain associated with the carbon neutrality target due 
to limited data, it is evident that the target does not meet the urgent 
timelines required for electric utilities in advanced economies, such 
as South Korea, which should aim for net-zero emissions by 2035 
(IEA, 2023c). Additionally, KEPCO’s carbon neutrality target excludes 
scope 3 emissions, which account for over half of the company’s 
current emissions. Bringing the company on the 1.5°C-compatible 
trajectory requires substantial emission reductions across all scopes, 
including scope 3.

Mars

Short-term targets towards 2030 High Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Reasonable

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Mars commits to reduce 2015 value chain emissions (roughly equal 
to 2019 emissions) by 27% by 2025, and by 50% by 2030.

No targets identified for the 2031-2040 period. Mars has pledged net-zero emissions by 2050.

Mars commits to an emissions reduction target of 80% by 2050 below 2019 levels across the entire value chain 
alongside its net-zero pledge. 

We assume that the company does not plan to claim land sequestration carbon dioxide removals towards this 80% 
target, as the company has explicitly ruled this out for its 50% 2030 target. 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Mars’s two short-term targets meet 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned 
milestones for the food and agriculture sector identified in existing 
literature. Teske (2022, p. 328) describes that between 2019 and 
2030, the food and agriculture industry should reduce its scope 3 
emissions by 34%. Mars specifies that it does not plan to use land 
sequestration carbon dioxide removals for the realisation of its 2030 
target. The company’s 2030 target goes beyond the benchmarks 
identified for the sector, and Mars has a short-term target for 2025 
that corresponds with its 2030 target too. 

Mars’s lack of targets for the period 2031-2040 
neglects the need for interim targets to chart a 
trajectory towards the company’s long-term vision 
as recommended by the UN High Level Expert 
Group on Net Zero (UN HLEG, 2022).

We find that Mars’s 2050 target meets 1.5°C Paris Agreement aligned milestones for food and agriculture sector. 
Teske (2022, p. 328) identifies 1.5°C-aligned absolute emission reduction milestones for various emission sources 
of agricultural activities, which represent upstream scope 3 emissions for Mars. All energy-related emissions need 
to reduce 100% by 2050, whereas AFOLU emissions and non-CO2 emissions need to reduce by 42% by 2050 below 
2019 levels. In sum, these required reductions mean a reduction of 51% across all scopes, below 2019 levels. Mars’s 
implied emission reduction commitment aligns with this.

The Transition Pathways Initiative (TPI) derives an emission intensity per tonne of agricultural input aligned with ‘1.5°C’ 
trajectories by 2050: 0.414 tCO2/tonne agricultural input (Dietz et al., 2022, p. 13). This represents an 85% reduction 
in intensity compared to 2.751 tCO2/tonne agricultural input in the 2020 base year. Due to a lack of information 
on intensity and volumes of agricultural input, we cannot directly assess whether Mars’s implied emission reduction 
commitment meets these intensity benchmarks. Moreover, TPI specifies that their benchmarks are developed for 
human food only, and Mars’s products are only partially for human consumption. However, Mars’s emission reduction 
target alongside its 2050 net-zero target contribute to the shift that is signalled by the required change in intensities. 
Boehm et al. (2023) describe emission reduction requirements of 29% for enteric fermentation and 39% for manure 
management, both below 2017 levels. Mars’s emission reduction target goes beyond these levels.

We cannot evaluate Mars’s target against SBTi’s FLAG Guidance and Net Zero Standard for this assessment due 
to the lack of specificity on the role of emission reductions vis-à-vis land sequestration CDR in those guidances, 
towards aligning with 1.5°C-compatible transition pathways for the sector. There are high uncertainties regarding 
the permanence and potential of CDR within the agrifood value chain.

We evaluate Mars’s implied emission reduction target reasonable rather than high because of the  lack of interim 
targets on five-year intervals, as per the recommendations of the UN High Level Expert Group on Net Zero (ISO, 
2022; UN HLEG, 2022).

Nestlé

Short-term targets towards 2030 Poor Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Unclear

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Nestlé pledges to reduce its emissions by 20% by 2025 and 50.4% by 2030, compared to a 2018 baseline, and to 
reduce its FLAG emissions by 50% by 2030.

We interpret that the pledge to reduce emissions by 50.4% by 2030 which translates to only 16%-24% emission 
reductions compared to the company’s full value chain emissions in 2019.  

In its Net Zero Roadmap (Nestlé, 2023b), Nestlé presents its interim emission reduction targets compared to a 
business-as-usual scenario and shows the targeted emission levels for each emission source for 2030. We calculate 
from the figures presented in the company’s Net Zero Roadmap (Nestlé, 2023b) that the company actually commits 
to reduce its full emission footprint from 116 MtCO2e in 2019 to between 91-97 MtCO2e in 2030. This would 
represent a reduction of just 16-24% of the company’s full value chain emissions. The stark difference between this 
range and the 50% target communicated by Nestlé lies in the company’s exclusion of various emission sources from 
its pledge, as well as the inclusion of measures for land sequestration and technical carbon removal and storage 
which Nestlé accounts as negative emissions.

The range of 16-24% is due to different potential interpretations of the unclearly defined measures to ‘transform the 
product portfolio’, through which Nestlé states that it plans to ‘reduce future emissions growth’ by 6 MtCO2e (Nestlé, 
2023b, p. 21). The upper end of the 16-24% range is based on the optimistic assumption that the 6 MtCO2e refers to 
further emission reductions across several emission sources and compared to 2019 levels. However, the ambiguous 
presentation of this measure in the Net Zero Roadmap could also refer to a 6 MtCO2e reduction compared to 
unspecified future emissions growth, which may not lead to any further emission reductions compared to 2019 levels. 

Nestlé sets no emissions reduction target for the 
medium-term towards 2040 (2031–2040).

Nestlé’s headline pledge of net-zero GHGs by 2050 includes a 
commitment to reduce emissions by 90% across its entire value chain 
compared to 2018 levels, and to reduce its scope 3 FLAG emissions 
by 75% compared to 2018 levels (SBTi, 2023e). These targets include 
both reductions and removals.

Due to an undefined role of land sequestration carbon dioxide 
removals, Nestlé’s emission reduction commitment remains unclear. 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Nestlé’s 2030 medium-term targets neither meet cross-sectoral nor sector-specific 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned 
decarbonisation milestones. The majority of Nestlé’s emission footprint derives from agricultural emissions. In 
the absence of available benchmarks from scientific literature for mixed-good retailers, we compare Nestlé’s 16-
24% emission reductions by 2030 to available 1.5°C-aligned benchmarks for agriculture, and cross-sector global 
benchmarks. Global cross-sectoral benchmarks require GHG and CO2 emissions to reduce by 43% and 48% between 
2019 and 2030, respectively  (IPCC, 2022). Pathways for global agriculture and food sector in Teske et al. (2022, p. 
328) indicate that scope 3 emissions should reduce by at least 34% between 2019 and 2030. Although the 50% 
reduction communicated by Nestlé would appear to align the company with these benchmarks, our interpretation 
of Nestlé’s target translates to just a 16-24% reduction of the full value chain emissions in 2019 means that Nestlé’s 
plans fall far short of any of these benchmarks. 

The SBTi published its guidance for Forest, Land, and Agriculture (FLAG) in 2022. Although the FLAG guidance 
requires companies to commit to annual reductions of at least 3.03%, translating to reductions of 30.3% between 
2020 and 2030 (SBTi, 2022a, pp. 44–45), this includes land sequestration CDR. We cannot use the FLAG guidance 
for this assessment due to the lack of specificity on the role of emission reductions vis-à-vis land sequestration CDR, 
towards aligning with 1.5°C-compatible transition pathways for the sector.

We are unable to compare Nestlé’s 2050 targets to sectoral 
1.5°C-aligned benchmarks as the exact target ambition remains 
unclear, due to an undefined role of land sequestration carbon 
dioxide removals.

Nike

Short-term targets towards 2030 Reasonable Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Reasonable

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Nike has set out two interim emission reduction targets: 

•	 Reduce scope 1 and scope 2 by 65% below 2015 levels by 2030.

•	 Reduce scope 3 by 30% below 2015 levels by 2030. This target excludes indirect emissions from the use phase 
of products (scope 3 category 11).

These targets jointly translate to a reduction of 41% by 2030 across the entire value chain below 2019 levels. To 
estimate the implied reduction in Nike’s targets, we consider their whole value chain emissions excluding indirect 
use phase emissions, which are calculated using the larger scope 2 estimate, which in Nike’s case is the location-
based estimate. However, because Nike’s targets clearly state that it only plans to reduce its market-based scope 2, 
we calculate the scope 2 emission reduction based on the market-based estimate, and then tally up that reduction 
against Nike’s full value chain emissions.

No targets identified. Nike’s long-term pledge includes a commitment to reach net-zero 
GHG emissions by 2050. Alongside its pledge, Nike commits to 
reducing its full value chain emissions (scope 1, 2, and 3) by 90% 
below 2015 levels.

This target represents a reduction of 91% by 2050 below 2019 
levels. Since the net zero pledge entails a commitment to deep 
decarbonisation across the entire value chain, we consider that the 
net zero terminology is unlikely to be misleading. Net-zero targets 
can give consumers and investors the impression that the company 
aims to reach deep levels of emission reductions, which Nike has 
committed to.

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Nike’s commitments for reductions across the value chain are close to meeting 1.5°C-aligned milestones identified 
in existing literature. According to the IPCC’s global economy-wide benchmarks to keep warming below 1.5°C, GHG 
emissions should reduce by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 (IPCC, 2022). Given that emissions in the fashion 
industry occur in various sectors, including agriculture and energy, we expect the industry to decarbonise at the same 
speed as this global trajectory. Nike’s targets, which represent a 41% reduction, are close to this global benchmark.

The company’s 2030 scope 3 target is almost aligned with other 1.5°C-compatible sectoral benchmarks. Nike’s 
scope 3 target of a 30% reduction below 2015 levels translates to a 40% reduction of scope 3 emissions below 2019 
levels. This falls just short of sectoral benchmarks, which require a reduction of upstream supply chain emissions of 
at least 41% by 2030. Teske (2022) considers that between 2019 and 2030, the textile and leather industry and the 
manufactured fibres and synthetic rubber industry should reduce their GHG emissions by 41% and 46%, respectively. 
This covers all emissions associated with producing fabrics and other materials and manufacturing the clothes, in 
other words: Nike’s upstream scope 3 emissions.

Nike’s lack of targets for the period 2031-2040 
neglects the need for interim targets to chart a 
trajectory towards the company’s long-term vision 
as recommended by the UN High Level Expert 
Group on Net Zero (UN HLEG, 2022). 

Nike’s 2050 target seems to be aligned with 1.5°C-compatible 
sectoral benchmarks. Teske (2022) considers that between 2019 and 
2050, the textile and leather industry and the manufactured fibres and 
synthetic rubber industry should reduce their scope 1 GHG emissions 
by 100%, scope 2 by 100%, and scope 3 by 48%. Nike’s implied target 
of reducing their whole value chain emissions by 91% below 2019 
levels seems to meet these benchmarks, although some uncertainties 
remain on whether the company’s target meets these benchmarks 
for all scopes. To clarify this, Nike could publish further details on 
how they plan to achieve their 2050 target, including reaching 100% 
renewables in their supply chain, and fully addressing emissions from 
manufacturing of their products from tier 2 to tier 4 suppliers.

Stellantis

Short-term targets towards 2030 Moderate Medium-term targets for the period 2031-2040 Reasonable

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Stellantis commits to an overarching intensity emission reduction target of 50% by 2030 across the entire value chain, 
compared to 2021 levels. The overarching interim target is supported by the following absolute and intensity targets, all 
using a 2021 base year: 

•	 To reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2025 and by 75% by 2030. 

•	 To reduce scope 3 emission intensity by 50% by 2030. 

•	 To sell 100% BEVs for passenger cars in Europe and 50% BEVs for passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the US by 2030. 

•	 To reduce the emission intensity of purchased parts per BEV by 40% by 2030

Due to the company’s recent formation, we cannot recalculate the targeted emission reductions compared to a 
2019 base year.

Stellantis’ headline pledge of carbon net zero by 2038 includes a commitment to reduce the emissions intensity across 
its vehicles’ life cycle by at least 90% across its entire value chain, compared to 2021 levels. Stellantis will subsequently 
offset less than 10% of its 2021 emissions by 2038. Due to the company’s recent formation, we cannot recalculate 
the targeted emission reductions to a 2019 base year. 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Stellantis’ 2030 targets meet some of the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for automobile manufacturers’ 
downstream scope 3 emissions, as identified in existing literature (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCC Race to Zero, 2021, pp. 
10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4; WBA, 2022; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023d, pp. 88, 93). To stay within the 
1.5°C temperature limit, sales of electric LDVs — those with zero tailpipe emissions — should reach 67%–95% by 2030 
globally (CAT, 2020, p. 27; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77-78; IEA, 2023b, pp. 88, 93). In Stellantis’ main markets such as the 
European Union and the US, electric LDV sales should reach 95%–100% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 in all leading markets 
(CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4). The company only meets these benchmarks for 
its target to sell 100% EVs in the EU by 2030 but fall short for its target of 50% in the US. In the US market, Stellantis 
aims to reach 100% by 2038 only.

Apart from the core targets for the EU and US markets, the company has not committed to any further phase-out dates 
for internal combustion engines in other sales markets or other vehicle categories, such as light commercial vehicles. 
Stellantis presented aspirational EV sale shares by 2030 for the Middle East and Africa regions, Brazil, India and the Asia 
Pacific region, and China, as part of its strategic blueprint Dare Forward 2030 published in 2022 (Stellantis, 2022). These 
indicative targets miss the 1.5°C-compatible sectoral benchmarks for Brazil, India, and China (CAT, 2020, p. 27). The 
targeted sale shares are: 

•	 >25% share of LEVs in the Middle East and Africa regions. 

•	 ~20% share of LEVs in Brazil (compared to 45-95% for all LDV sales being electric by 2030 in the 1.5°C-aligned 
scenarios). 

•	 ~50% share of BEVs in India and the Asia Pacific region (compared to 80-95% for all LDV sales being electric by 
2030 in the 1.5°C-aligned scenarios, including two- and three-wheelers). 

•	 60% of share of passenger car BEVs in China (compared to 95-100% for all LDV sales being electric by 2030 in the 
1.5°C-aligned scenarios, including two- and three-wheelers).

Stellantis no longer claims that its scope 3 emissions 2030 targets are aligned with SBTi. Instead, it refers to the SBTi’s 
guidance on the transport sector for its scope 1 and 2 targets, which it claims are aligned with a 1.5°C scenario (Stellantis, 
2023, p. 113). 

Stellantis’ 2038 targets meet some of the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for automobile manufactures. 
The automobile industry should only sell electric vehicles by 2030–2035 globally to comply with the 1.5°C-compatible 
decarbonisation milestones (CAT, 2020, p. 27; Boehm et al., 2021, pp. 77–78; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; IEA, 2022a, 
p. 27; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4). Stellantis does not explicitly commit to this specific benchmark for its entire vehicle 
fleet sold globally by 2040. Instead, it focuses on certain markets, such as the EU by 2030 and the US by 2038, which 
were responsible for 76% of all sales in 2022 (Stellantis, 2023b, p. 37). We could not identify regional reduction 
trajectories aligned with the 1.5°C.

Tesco

Short-term targets towards 2030 Very poor Medium-term targets for the period 2031-2040 Poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Moderate

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Scope 1 and 2, base year 2015:

•	 Reduce emissions by 85%, by 2030 (voluntary target)

Tesco’s short-term targets equate to emission reductions of 1% compared 
to 2019 value chain emissions.

Scope 1 and 2, base year 2015:

•	 Reduce emissions by 83%, by 2032

•	 Reduce emissions by 90%, by 2035

Scope 3, base year 2019:

•	 Reduce non-FLAG emissions by 55%, by 2032

•	 Reduce FLAG emissions by 39%, by 2032

Tesco medium-targets equate to emission reductions of 27-45% compared 
to 2019 value chain emissions, but the role of land sequestration carbon 
dioxide removals remains unclear.

The range is related to uncertainties around the exact scope coverage of the 
medium-term targets. Tesco reports higher emissions for scope 3, category 
11 (use of sold products) and lower emissions for category 3 (fuel and energy-
related activities), than the company reports in its baseline emissions of the 
targets. Both the lower and higher end of the range includes the presented 
baseline emissions for category 3, rather than the lower reported emissions. 
For the lower end of the range, we use the reported emissions for category 
11, and apply the reported coverage share on those emissions. We assume 
the share of emissions not covered under target to stay constant. The higher 
range of the emissions uses the same coverage share that Tesco reports, 
but applies it on the reported baseline emissions.

Net-zero emissions by 2050.

Scope 3, base year 2019:

•	 Reduce non-FLAG emissions by 90%, by 2050

•	 Reduce FLAG emissions by 72%, by 2050

Tesco commits to emissions reduction targets of at least 90% by 2050 below 2019 
levels for non-FLAG emissions in scope 3, and 72% for FLAG emissions in scope 
3. The targets equate to emission reductions of 63-74% compared to 2019 value 
chain emissions. To determine this range, we applied the same methodological steps 
as explained for the medium-term targets. 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Due to the lack of scope 3 targets, Tesco’s short-term emission reduction 
commitment is far below a 1.5°C trajectory for the sector and can be 
considered to be of low significance in the context of the company’s full 
GHG emission footprint. Teske (2022, p. 328) describes that between 2019 and 
2030, the food and agriculture industry should reduce its scope 3 emissions by 
34%. Overall, the company’s 2030 target does not align with this benchmark. 

Boehm et al. (2023) describe emission reduction requirements of 17% for 
enteric fermentation and 21% for manure management, both below 2017 
levels. Tesco does not meet these emission reduction levels with its 2030 target.

The SBTi published its guidance for Forest, Land, and Agriculture (FLAG) in 2022. 
Although the FLAG guidance requires companies to commit to annual reductions of 
at least 3.03%, translating to reductions of 30.3% between 2020 and 2030 (SBTi, 
2022b, pp. 44–45), this includes land sequestration carbon dioxide removals. We 
cannot use the FLAG guidance for this assessment due to the lack of specificity on 
the role of emission reductions vis-à-vis land sequestration CDR, towards aligning 
with 1.5°C-compatible transition pathways for the sector. If we were to include 
the 30.3% benchmark, Tesco’s short-term targets would also not align with this 
benchmark due to its negligible emission reduction commitment.

Due to the limited scope coverage and limited ambition, Tesco’s range of 
short-term targets do not meet 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones 
for the food and agriculture sector identified in existing literature.

Tesco’s target for non-FLAG emissions is close to 1.5°C benchmarks, but the 
meaning of its target for FLAG emissions is unclear.

Tesco’s targets for non-FLAG emissions, accounting for two-thirds of its emissions 
footprint, reflect a commitment to deep emission reductions, but fall short of 1.5°C 
benchmarks for the sector. Teske (2022, p. 328) identifies 1.5°C-aligned absolute 
emission reduction milestones for various emission sources of agricultural activities, 
finding that all energy-related emissions need to reduce 100% by 2050. 

However, since Tesco claims to fully align its strategy with the SBTi FLAG guidance, 
there is a substantial likelihood that the company will depend on extensive land 
sequestration carbon dioxide removal in the value chain for realising its targets 
for FLAG emissions. We do not consider this an adequate approach to claim 
neutralisation of emissions, among other reasons, due to high uncertainties regarding 
permanence and potential. 

Due to the lack of clarity on the extent to which the FLAG target will be achieved 
through real emission reductions, we consider that there is effectively a lack of any 
specific commitment for reducing these FLAG emissions. We also do not identify 
clear signals from the company’s measures or other target that would suggest that 
there is a clear plan to embark on the agricultural transitions that would be necessary 
to significantly reduce agricultural emissions, especially methane and nitrous oxide.

Toyota

Short-term targets towards 2030 Very poor Medium-term targets 
for the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for 

the period beyond 2040     Very poor

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?
Toyota commits to the following emission reduction targets by 2030:
•	 Scope 1 & 2: 30% absolute emissions reduction from scope 1 and 2 by 2025 (below 2013 levels, without allowing offsets to meet the target).
•	 Scope 3 – Category 11

•	 30% CO2 emissions intensity reduction per kilometre for passenger light-duty vehicles and light commercial vehicles by 2025 for Japan, United 
States, Europe, China, Canada, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, India, Australia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia (below 2010 levels, not allowing for offsets to 
meet the target)

•	 33.3% CO2 emissions intensity reduction per vehicle kilometre for passenger light-duty vehicles and light commercial vehicles by 2030 (below 
2019 levels, without allowing offsets to meet the target).

•	 11.6% CO2 emissions intensity reduction per vehicle kilometre for medium and heavy freight trucks by 2030 (below 2019 levels, without allowing 
offsets to meet the target).

•	 All emissions scopes across the value chain
•	 18% GHG emissions intensity reduction per vehicle across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2025 (below 2013 levels, without allowing offsets to 

meet the target)
•	 30% GHG emissions intensity reduction per vehicle across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2030 (below 2019 levels, without allowing offsets to 

meet the target)

Toyota has also set a target to reach a 50% sales share of electric vehicles by 2030 and only sell zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 for the European Union 
and the United Kingdom (Toyota Europe, 2021, 2023a). In a written submission to the House of Lords Environment and Climate Change Committee, Toyota 
Europe suggested that 100% zero emission vehicle sales would be expected in the United Kingdom (Toyota Europe, 2023a, p. 5).

We cannot independently quantify Toyota’s interim intensity targets in terms of absolute emission reduction by 2030. Toyota has disclosed to CDP that 
its 2030 target for LDVs is equivalent to an estimated 23.1% reduction of absolute emissions from scope 3 category 11, and its 2030 target for HDVs is 
equivalent to an estimated 0.5% (Toyota, 2023d). This CDP disclosure is not publicly available, and the assumptions that underpin the estimate are not 
clear (e.g., for sales volumes assumed in 2030).

Toyota commits to the following emission reduction 
targets by 2035:
•	 Scope 1 & 2

•	 68% absolute emissions reduction by 2035 
across scope 1 and scope 2 emissions 
(below 2019 levels, without allowing offsets 
to meet the target).

•	 Carbon neutrality for CO2 emissions from 
production plants’ scope 1 and scope 2 
emissions by 2035 (no base year, with 
offsets allowed to meet target)

•	 Downstream Scope 3 – Category 11: 50% CO2 
emissions intensity reduction per kilometre 
for new vehicles by 2035 (below 2019 levels, 
without allowing offsets to meet the target).

Toyota’s 2035 absolute emissions reduction target 
for scope 1 and 2 is equivalent to less than a 1% 
emission reduction by 2035 below 2019 levels across 
the entire value chain. We cannot independently 
quantify Toyota’s 2035 interim intensity targets for 
scope 3 emissions.

Toyota – as well as subsidiary Hino, which produces 
heavy-duty vehicles – aim to achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2050, but neither Toyota nor Hino 
commit to a specific emissions reduction target 
alongside this pledge. Since the company’s carbon 
neutrality pledge does not entail any explicit 
commitment to deep decarbonisation, labelling it 
as a ‘carbon neutrality target’ may be misleading 
and commits to the following scope-specific pledges 
by 2050:
•	 Scope 1 & 2

•	 Carbon neutrality for GHG emissions from 
corporate activities by 2050

•	 Zero CO2 emissions from production plants’ 
scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050

•	 Downstream Scope 3 – Category 11: Carbon 
neutrality for average GHG emissions per 
vehicle by 2050

•	 All emissions scopes across the value chain: 
Carbon neutrality for GHG emissions per 
vehicle by 2050 across scope 1,2 and 3 
emissions

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?
Light-duty vehicles
Toyota’s 2030 interim targets do not meet 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for automobile manufacturers’ downstream scope 3 emissions, 
as identified in existing literature (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4; WBA, 2022; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 
2023c, pp. 88, 93). Sales of electric light-duty vehicles with  zero tailpipe emissions should reach 67%–95% by 2030 globally to stay below the 1.5°C warming 
limit (CAT, 2020; Boehm et al., 2023; IEA, 2023c). In Toyota’s main markets such as the European Union, China and the US, electric LDV sales should reach 
95%–100% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 across all leading markets (CAT, 2020; UNFCCC, 2021; IPCC, 2022; Teske et al., 2022). 

The company significantly falls short of the global 1.5°C-aligned benchmarks for 2030, and it provides no market-specific phase-out dates for internal 
combustion engines. Toyota’s target to reach a 50% sales share of electric vehicles by 2030 in the EU and the UK reflects the automobile sector’s business-
as-usual development for Europe, rather than a 1.5°C-compatible climate ambition going beyond this. The IEA estimates that the EV sales share for Europe 
will reach around 50% under its stated policies and announced pledges scenario (IEA, 2023b, p. 114). We cannot identify such targets for its other key 
markets. Toyota aims to sell 3.5m BEVs globally by 2030 (Toyota, 2023b). 
Toyota still refers to the SBTi’s ‘Below 2°C’ validation of its scope 3 emissions intensity target (Toyota, 2023b). However, SBTi has indefinitely paused the 
use of its methodology for automakers, citing its incompatibility with the 1.5°C temperature limit (SBTi, 2022f). The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) 
does not deem the company’s 2030 targets for downstream scope 3 emissions as aligned with its Below 2 Degrees Scenario benchmark (TPI, 2023a). The 
TPI’s assessment compares its Below 2 Degree Scenario benchmark of below 81 gCO2e/vkm and its 1.5 Degree benchmark of below 31 gCO2e/vkm to its 
interpretation of Toyota’s 2030 target of 90 gCO2e/vkm.

Heavy-duty vehicles
We cannot independently assess Toyota’s climate targets for heavy-duty vehicles against existing 1.5°C-aligned benchmarks. While Toyota and Hino 
commit to intensity reduction targets for the heavy-duty vehicles’ use phase emissions at the group and subsidiary level, respectively, the companies provide 
no explanation on how these targets relate to each other. We cannot directly compare Toyota’s intensity per vehicle-km targets this to existing intensity 
benchmarks expressed in emissions per tonne kilometres, which define 1.5°C-compatible emission intensities from the use of heavy-duty trucks as of 
30–61 gCO2 per tonne kilometres by 2030 (IEA, 2023c; Teske et al., 2023 data provided in Dataset 2). However, Toyota estimates that this will reduce total 
scope 3 emissions only by 0.5% by 2030 below 2019 levels (Toyota, 2023d). 

We cannot identify targets for the phase-in of zero emission heavy-duty vehicles by 2030, neither at the group level by Toyota nor at the subsidiary level 
by Hino. Recent literature indicates that the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-compatible shares should be 30–37% of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell 
electric vehicles (FCEVs) heavy-duty trucks in global annual sales by 2030 (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93).

Toyota’s 2035 interim targets do not meet 1.5°C 
Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for automobile 
manufacturers’ downstream scope 3 emissions 
for light-duty vehicles, as identified in existing 
literature (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, 
pp. 10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4; WBA, 2022; 
Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 
93). All light-duty vehicle (LDVs) sales should be 
electric—that is, have zero tailpipe emissions—by 
2035 in key markets such as Japan, the European 
Union, China and the US to stay below the 1.5°C 
warming limit (CAT, 2020, p. 27; Boehm et al., 2023, 
pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). The company 
only provides market-specific internal combustion 
engines (ICE) phase-out dates for the European 
Union and the United Kingdom, where Toyota has 
set a target to only sell zero-emissions vehicles 
by 2035 (Toyota Europe, 2021, 2023a). We could 
not identify such targets for its other key markets. 
Toyota has not signed the non-legally binding 
declaration committing to a fully electric fleet by 
2035 to support achieving the 1.5°C target of the 
Paris Agreement, despite competing manufacturers 
signing up to it (COP26 Presidency, 2021; A2Z 
Coalition, 2023).

We find the absence of any post-2040 emission 
reduction target alongside Toyota’s carbon neutrality 
goal highly insufficient, especially considering 
the urgent need for deep and credible emission 
reductions towards mid-century to have a reasonable 
chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC, 
2022) . To align with the 1.5°C-compatible 
decarbonisation milestones, the automobile industry 
should transition to selling only electric vehicles 
globally by 2030–2035 (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 
2021, pp. 10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4; WBA, 
2022; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, 
pp. 88, 93). In 2022, downstream emissions from 
the use of sold vehicles amounted to around 76% 
of Toyota’s emissions in 2022, but the company has 
not committed to any phase-out dates for internal 
combustion engines across its different brands in 
the context of its carbon neutrality pledge.

Volkswagen Group

Short-term targets towards 2030 Poor Medium-term targets 
for the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for 

the period beyond 2040     Very poor

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?
Volkswagen Group commits to the following emission reduction targets towards 2030:
•	 30% intensity emissions reduction per kilometre for new passenger cars and light-duty vehicles by 2030 (below 2018 levels, without allowing 

offsets to meet the target).
•	 50.4% absolute emissions reduction by 2030 across scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (below 2018 levels, without allowing offsets to meet the 

target).

The Volkswagen Group further communicates several targeted sales shares for electric light-duty vehicles by 2030:
•	 at least 70% in the European Union
•	 at least 50% in the United States and China
The Volkswagen Group states that these targets represent minimum requirements for the Group’s brands. Each brand may set additional targets going 
beyond the group-level targets for this timeframe (Volkswagen, 2023, p. 47). While Volkswagen does not commit to group-level targets for heavy-duty 
vehicles, each of the four brands under its subsidiary Traton sets its own targets (Traton, 2023a, pp. 17, 23, see also Box 1 in the written assessment).

Volkswagen’s 2030 absolute emissions reduction target for scope 1 and 2 is equivalent to a 3% emission reduction by 2030 below 2019 levels across 
the entire value chain. We cannot independently quantify Volkswagen’s interim intensity targets for scope 3 emissions. Volkswagen has disclosed to CDP 
that this target is equivalent to an estimated 6% reduction of absolute emissions from scope 3 category 11 (Volkswagen, 2023a). This CDP disclosure 
is not publicly available, and the assumptions that underpin the estimate are not clear, for example for sales volumes assumed in 2030.

Volkswagen no longer refers to any group-wide short-term targets towards 2030 within a five-year interval in its latest sustainability reporting of 2023 
(Volkswagen, 2023b, 2023c, 2023a). Previously, the company had set a 2025 intensity reduction target for CO2 emission of new vehicles that explicitly 
relied on an unspecified amount of offsets (Volkswagen, 2022, pp. 26, 46).

Volkswagen sets no emissions reduction targets for 
medium-term towards 2040 (2031–2040). 

Some of Volkswagen’s brands like Audi or 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars do communicate 
aspirational sales shares for electric light-duty 
vehicles for their respective brands (Waldersee, 
2022; Audi, 2024). For example, Audi intends to 
gradually phasing out the production of combustion 
engines by 2033 (Audi, 2024). Volkswagen Group 
does not present them as integral part of their group-
level climate strategy.  

The Volkswagen Group aims to achieve carbon neutrality 
by 2050, but does not commit to a deep emissions 
reduction target alongside its 2040 net-zero pledge. 
Since the company’s carbon neutrality pledge does not 
entail any explicit commitment to deep decarbonisation, 
labelling it as a ‘carbon neutrality target’ may be 
misleading. 

Volkswagen’s subsidiaries – Scania, MAN and Porsche 
– have further committed to own long-term net-zero 
and carbon neutrality targets by 2040 or beyond 
(Volkswagen, 2023b, p. 47). 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?
Light-duty vehicles
Volkswagen’s 2030 interim targets do not meet the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for automobile manufacturers’ scope 3 emissions from 
the use of light-duty vehicles (LDVs), as identified in existing literature (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4; WBA, 
2022; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). Sales of electric LDVs, with zero tailpipe emissions, should reach 67%–95% by 2030 
globally to stay below the 1.5°C warming limit (CAT, 2020; Boehm et al., 2023; IEA, 2023c). In Volkswagen’s main markets such as the European Union, 
China and the US, electric LDV sales should  reach 95%–100% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 across all main markets (CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, 
pp. 10–11; Teske et al., 2022, p. 4). 

The Volkswagen Group commits to reach at least a 50% electric vehicle share by 2030 in the US and China, and at least 70% in the European Union 
(Volkswagen, 2023c, p. 8). These three markets jointly represent 85% of all vehicles sales in 2022 (Volkswagen, 2023d, p. 128). The company significantly 
falls short of the global 1.5°C-aligned benchmarks for 2030, and it provides no market-specific phaseout dates for internal combustion engines. 

The Volkswagen Group still refers to the SBTi’s ‘2°C’ verification of its scope 3 emissions intensity target (Volkswagen, 2023b, p. 47). However, SBTi 
has indefinitely paused the use of its methodology for automakers, citing its incompatibility with the 1.5°C target (SBTi, 2022f). The Transition Pathway 
Initiative (TPI) does not deem the company’s 2030 targets for downstream scope 3 emissions as aligned with its Below 2 Degrees Scenario benchmark 
(TPI, 2023b). The TPI’s interpretation of Volkswagen’s 2030 target of 114 gCO2e/vkm falls significantly short of its Below 2 Degree Scenario benchmark 
(lower than 81 gCO2e/vkm) and its 1.5 Degree benchmark (lower than 31 gCO2e/vkm). 

Heavy-duty vehicles
Volkswagen produces heavy-duty trucks and buses through its subsidiary Traton. Traton manages four different vehicle brands: Scania, MAN, Navistar, 
and Volkswagen Truck & Bus.

The 2030 targets by Traton’s four brands mostly meet 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for downstream scope 3 emissions of heavy-duty 
vehicle manufacturers, as identified in existing literature (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Mission Possible Partnership, 2022, p. 40; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 
77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). MAN, Scania and Navistar International Cooperation — covering 26 out of Volkswagen Group’s 28 production sites for 
heavy-duty vehicles — all pledge to reach at least 40% sales share of heavy-duty zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2030 (Traton, 2023a, p. 17). These 
commitments are in line with the global 1.5°C-compatible shares for heavy-duty trucks of 30–37% of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell 
electric vehicles (FCEVs) by 2030 (UNFCCC, 2021; Boehm et al., 2023; IEA, 2023c). Trucks represented 83% of all heavy-duty vehicle sales by Traton 
in 2022 (Traton, 2023b). Volkswagen Truck & Bus —Volkswagen Group’s fourth brand producing heavy-duty vehicles in Brazil — has not committed to 
any target to increase the sales share of heavy-duty vehicles. 

Volkswagen’s absence of targets for the period 
2031-2040 neglects the need for interim targets 
to chart a trajectory towards the company’s long-
term vision, as recommended by the UN High Level 
Expert Group on Net Zero (UN HLEG, 2022).

We find the absence of any post-2040 emission 
reduction targets alongside Volkswagen Group’s carbon 
neutrality goal highly insufficient, especially considering 
the urgent need for substantial and credible emission 
reductions towards mid-century to have a reasonable 
chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2022).

To align with the 1.5°C-compatible decarbonisation 
milestones, the automobile industry should transition 
to selling only electric vehicles globally by 2030–2035 
(CAT, 2020, p. 27; UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; Teske 
et al., 2022, p. 4; WBA, 2022; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 
77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). In 2022, downstream 
emissions from the use of sold vehicles constituted 
around 74% of Volkswagen’s emissions, but the company 
has not committed to any phase-out dates for internal 
combustion engines across its different brands in the 
context of its carbon neutrality pledge.

Volvo Group

Short-term targets towards 2030 Reasonable Medium-term targets for 
the period 2031-2040 Unclear Long-term targets for

the period beyond 2040     N/A

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Volvo Group commits to the following emission reduction targets by 2030 below 2019 levels:

•	 50% absolute emissions reduction across scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.

•	 30% absolute emissions reduction from use of construction equipment (part of scope 3 category 11 emissions)

•	 40% CO2 emissions intensity reduction per vehicle kilometre for heavy-duty trucks

•	 40% CO2 emissions intensity reduction per vehicle kilometre for buses

Apart from these emission reduction targets, Volvo Group commits to selling “at least” 35% of electric vehicles by 
2030 (Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 16, 151).

Volvo Group’s 2030 absolute emissions reduction target for scopes 1 and 2 is equivalent to less than a 1% reduction 
by 2030 below 2019 levels across the entire value chain. We cannot independently quantify Volvo Group’s interim 
intensity targets for scope 3 emissions.

The Volvo Group aims to achieve net-zero emissions across 
the entire value chain by 2040, but does not commit to a 
deep emissions reduction target alongside its 2040 net-zero 
pledge. Since the company’s carbon neutrality pledge does 
not entail any explicit commitment to deep decarbonisation, 
labelling it as a ‘carbon neutrality target’ may be misleading.

In addition, the company commits to an 37.5% absolute 
emissions reduction by 2034 from the use of sold industrial and 
marine engines as part of its scope 3 category 11 emissions.

Volvo Group communicates no additional emission 
reduction targets for the long-term beyond 2040. For 
this reason, the issues discussed around the Volvo Group’s 
2040 net-zero target and its indicative electric vehicle 
shares under an ‘illustrative scenario for 1.5°C’ similarly 
apply for the period beyond 2040 (see assessment above). 

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

The Volvo Group’s 2030 interim targets mostly meet 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for heavy-duty 
vehicle manufacturers’ downstream scope 3 emissions, as identified in existing literature (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 
10–11; Mission Possible Partnership, 2022, p. 40; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). Volvo 
Group commits to selling “at least” 35% of electric vehicles by 2030 (Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 16, 151). However, the 
company does not further differentiate between heavy-duty trucks, buses, and other construction equipment and 
industrial machinery. For heavy-duty trucks, recent literature identifies the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-compatible range 
of 30–37% battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) sold by 2030 globally (UNFCCC, 
2021, pp. 10–11; Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). Volvo Group’s target, if applied to heavy-
duty trucks responsible for 66% of the company’s revenue in 2022, would thus meet this benchmark range. For 
buses, the 1.5°C Paris Agreement-compatible sales share of BEVs and FCEVs must reach between 56–60% by 2030 
globally and 100% by 2030 in advanced economies and China (UNFCCC, 2021; IPCC, 2022; Boehm et al., 2023; 
IEA, 2023c) Volvo Group’s target, if applied to buses responsible for 4% of the company’s revenue in 2022, would 
fall short of this benchmark range.

We cannot independently assess Volvo Group’s medium-
term targets towards 2040 against existing 1.5°C-aligned 
benchmarks for the heavy-duty vehicle sector. Unlike for 
2030, Volvo Group provides no specific target share for electric 
vehicles by 2040 but rather shows indicative shares under an 
“illustrative scenario for 1.5°C” (Volvo Group, 2023a, pp. 16, 
155). This includes an unspecified share of internal combustion 
engines using sustainable biofuels and other fossil-free fuels. 
For heavy-duty trucks, recent literature identifies the 1.5°C 
Paris Agreement-compatible shares of battery electric vehicles 
(BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) of 100% by 2040 
in advanced economies and China (UNFCCC, 2021, pp. 10–11; 
Boehm et al., 2023, pp. 77–78; IEA, 2023c, pp. 88, 93). 

We further consider the lack of an emission reduction target 
alongside Volvo Group’s group-wide 2040 net-zero target 
as insufficient, considering the need for deep and credible 
emission reductions towards mid-century to stand a reasonable 
chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2022).

Walmart

Short-term targets towards 2030 Very poor Medium-term targets for the period 2031-2040 Very poor Long-term targets for the period beyond 2040     Very poor

 What are the targets and what do they actually mean?

Walmart committed to the following emission reduction targets for 2030:	

•	 Scope 1 and scope 2: 35% emission reduction by 2025 from 2015. 

•	 Scope 1 and scope 2: 65% emission reduction by 2030 from 2015.

Walmart’s short- and medium-targets translate to reducing emissions by 5% by 2030, compared 
to 2019 value chain emissions.

Walmart committed to zero emissions in operations by 2040 (scope 
1 and 2). 

We estimate that Walmart’s emission reduction target is equivalent to 
a commitment to reduce around 9% of its emissions across the value 
chain by 2040, compared to 2019 levels. Walmart’s 2040 target covers 
only scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, which account for approximately 
9% of the company’s GHG emission footprint in 2019.

Walmart sets no emissions reduction target for the long-term beyond 
2040 (from 2041 onwards).

 Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?

Walmart’s scope 3 emissions account for 95% if its emission footprint. In the absence of available 
benchmarks from scientific literature for mixed-good retailers, we compare Walmart’s 5% 
emission reductions by 2030 to available 1.5°C-aligned benchmark. Walmart’s 2030 medium-
term targets neither meet cross-sectoral nor sector-specific 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned 
decarbonisation milestones. Teske (2022, p. 328) describes that between 2019 and 2030, the 
food and agriculture industry should reduce its scope 3 emissions by 34%. Walmart’s short-term 
targets falls far short of this benchmark. 

The SBTi published its guidance for Forest, Land, and Agriculture (FLAG) in 2022. Although the 
FLAG guidance requires companies to commit to annual reductions of at least 3.03%, translating 
to reductions of 30.3% between 2020 and 2030 (SBTi, 2022b, pp. 44–45), this includes land 
sequestration carbon dioxide removals. We cannot use the FLAG guidance for this assessment 
due to the lack of specificity on the role of emission reductions vis-à-vis land sequestration 
CDR, towards aligning with 1.5°C-compatible transition pathways for the sector. If we were to 
include the 30.3%  benchmark, Walmart’s commitments would fall far short of it.

We consider the lack of any post-2030 emission reduction commitments 
for scope 3, alongside Walmart’s targets for scope 1 and 2 as highly 
insufficient, considering the need for deep and credible emission 
reductions towards mid-century to stand a reasonable chance of limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2022).

Annex III – Additional assumptions for Part A analysis

Stellantis
We interpret Stellantis’ intensity targets for 2030 (50% by 2030 below 
2021 across all value chain emissions) as an absolute target, assuming 
constant activity levels. 

Toyota
For the upper bound estimate, we assume that Toyota’s intensity 
targets are equivalent to absolute emission reduction targets. For this 
purpose, we interpret Toyota’s intensity targets for light-duty vehicles 
(LDVs) for 2030 (33.3% by 2030 below 2019 for downstream scope 
3 use phase emissions) as an absolute target, assuming constant 
activity levels. Similarly, we interpret Toyota’s intensity targets for 
heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) for 2030 (11.6% by 2030 below 2019 
for downstream scope 3 use phase emissions) as an absolute target, 
assuming constant activity levels. Together with Toyota’s absolute 
target for scope 1 and 2 (30% by 2025 below 2013), these targets 
jointly translate into a 26% absolute reduction by 2030 below 2019 
levels across the entire value chain.

For the lower bound estimate, we use the estimate provided by CDP 
for Toyota’s 2030 LDV and HDV intensity target, which indicates  
an estimated 23.1% reduction of absolute emissions from scope 3 
category 11 for LDVs and a 0.5% reduction for HDVs (Toyota, 2023d). 
It is important to note that the CDP disclosure is not publicly available, 
and the assumptions underpinning the estimate are unclear (e.g., 
for sales volumes assumed in 2030). When combined with Toyota’s 
absolute target for scope 1 and 2 (30% by 2025 below 2013), these 
targets jointly translate into a 17% absolute reduction by 2030 below 
2019 levels across the entire value chain.

Volkswagen
For the upper bound estimate, we assume that the Volkswagen’s 
intensity targets are equivalent to absolute emission reduction targets. 
For this purpose, we interpret Volkswagen’s intensity targets for LDVs 
for 2030 (30% by 2030 below 2018 for downstream scope 3 use 
phase emissions) as an absolute target, assuming constant activity 
levels. While neither Volkswagen nor Traton set group-level targets 
for HDVs, the brands Scania (20% intensity reduction per vehicle km 
by 2025 below 2015), MAN (28% intensity reduction per vehicle km 
by 2030 below 2019) and Navistar (24–25% gCO2e/ton mile by 2027 
below 2017) do so at the brand level. We assume these translate into 
a 20% intensity reduction across all HDV brands below 2019 levels 
and, subsequently, an absolute target assuming constant activity 
levels. Together with Volkswagen’s absolute target for scope 1 and 
2 (50.4% by 2030 below 2018), these targets collectively translate 
into a 23% absolute reduction by 2030 below 2019 levels across 
the entire value chain.

For the lower bound estimate, we follow the same approach for HDVs 
as outlined above but use the estimate for Volkswagen’s 2030 LDVs 
intensity target disclosed by CDP, which indicates an estimated 6% 
reduction of absolute emissions from scope 3 category 11 for LDVs 
(Volkswagen, 2023a). It is important to note that the CDP disclosure is 
not publicly available, and the assumptions underpinning the estimate 
are unclear (e.g., for sales volumes assumed in 2030). When combined 
with Volkswagen’s absolute target for scope 1 and 2 (50.4% by 2030 
below 2018), these targets jointly translate into a 13% absolute 
reduction by 2030 below 2019 levels across the entire value chain.

The aggregated impact analysis across the 20 companies’ climate strategies assessed in Section A of the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024 contains several assumptions that are additional to the assumptions 
presented in the individual company assessments in Section B. These additional assumptions concern the interpretation of corporate intensity targets for automobile manufacturers. Several companies commit to intensity 
targets for the period up to 2030 that cannot directly be translated into absolute emission reduction commitments. To give a most optimistic scenario of the emission reductions that companies’ emission reductions 
could lead to, we present aggregated findings with the scenario that companies’ intensity targets will lead to an equivalent emissions reduction in absolute terms. In other words, we present the scenario that activity levels 
remain constant until 2030. We consider that this aggregated scenario is highly optimistic and unlikely in some cases; accordingly, we do not use this optimistic scenario for the company-specific integrity assessments 
in Section B, where we evaluate companies’ real commitments.

Volvo Group
We interpret Volvo Group’s intensity targets for trucks and buses for 
2030 (40% by 2030 below 2019 for downstream scope 3 use phase 
emissions each) as an absolute target, assuming constant activity levels. 
Together with Volvo Group’s absolute target for scope 1 and 2 (50% 
by 2030 below 2013), the use phase of emissions of construction 
equipment (30% by 2030 below 2019) and the use phase of emissions 
from industrial and marine engines (37.5% by 2034 below 2019), 
these targets jointly translate into a 35% absolute reduction by 2030 
below 2019 levels across the entire value chain.

162Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024



The rapid acceleration in the volume of corporate climate pledges, combined with 
the fragmentation of approaches and the general lack of regulation or oversight, 
means that it is more difficult than ever to distinguish between real climate 
leadership and unsubstantiated greenwashing.

The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2024 evaluates the 
climate strategies of 20 major corporations. It critically analyses the 
transparency and integrity of corporate pledges and claims to 
identify replicable good practice and areas for improvement.
